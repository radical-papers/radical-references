With over 5,000 users and over 600 different applications utilizing NERSC systems, it is critically important to examine the workload running on NERSCs large supercomputers in order to procure systems that perform well for a broad workload. In this paper we show the breakdown of the NERSC workload by science area, algorithm, memory, thread usage and more. We also describe the methods used to collect data from NERSCs Hopper (Cray XE6) system.}, author={Austin, Brian and Butler, Tina and Gerber, Richard and Whitney, Cary and Wright, Nicholas and Yang, Woo-Sun and Zhao, Zhengji}, year={2014}, month={May}}
