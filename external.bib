  abstract = {Calculation of protein-ligand binding affinities continues to be a
	hotbed of research. Although many techniques for computing protein-ligand
	binding affinities have been introduced--ranging from computationally
	very expensive approaches, such as free energy perturbation (FEP)
	theory; to more approximate techniques, such as empirically derived
	scoring functions, which, although computationally efficient, lack
	a clear theoretical basis--there remains pressing need for more robust
	approaches. A recently introduced technique, the displaced-solvent
	functional (DSF) method, was developed to bridge the gap between
	the high accuracy of FEP and the computational efficiency of empirically
	derived scoring functions. In order to develop a set of reference
	data to test the DSF theory for calculating absolute protein-ligand
	binding affinities, we have pursued FEP theory calculations of the
	binding free energies of a methane ligand with 13 different model
	hydrophobic enclosures of varying hydrophobicity. The binding free
	energies of the methane ligand with the various hydrophobic enclosures
	were then recomputed by DSF theory and compared with the FEP reference
	data. We find that the DSF theory, which relies on no empirically
	tuned parameters, shows excellent quantitative agreement with the
	FEP. We also explored the ability of buried solvent accessible surface
	area and buried molecular surface area models to describe the relevant
	physics, and find the buried molecular surface area model to offer
	superior performance over this dataset.},

  abstract = {Understanding the underlying physics of the binding of small-molecule
	ligands to protein active sites is a key objective of computational
	chemistry and biology. It is widely believed that displacement of
	water molecules from the active site by the ligand is a principal
	(if not the dominant) source of binding free energy. Although continuum
	theories of hydration are routinely used to describe the contributions
	of the solvent to the binding affinity of the complex, it is still
	an unsettled question as to whether or not these continuum solvation
	theories describe the underlying molecular physics with sufficient
	accuracy to reliably rank the binding affinities of a set of ligands
	for a given protein. Here we develop a novel, computationally efficient
	descriptor of the contribution of the solvent to the binding free
	energy of a small molecule and its associated receptor that captures
	the effects of the ligand displacing the solvent from the protein
	active site with atomic detail. This descriptor quantitatively predicts
	(R(2) = 0.81) the binding free energy differences between congeneric
	ligand pairs for the test system factor Xa, elucidates physical properties
	of the active-site solvent that appear to be missing in most continuum
	theories of hydration, and identifies several features of the hydration
	of the factor Xa active site relevant to the structure-activity relationship
	of its inhibitors.},

	an interesting target for the development of antitumor agents. In
	this work we first investigate the active site of FTase by mapping
	its hydrophobic patches. Then the program SEED is used to dock functional
	groups into the active site by an exhaustive search and efficient
	evaluation of the binding energy with solvation. The electrostatic
	energy is SEED is based on the continuum dielectric approximation
	and consists of screened intermolecular energy and protein and fragment
	desolvation terms. The results are found to be consistent with the
	sequence variability of the tetrapeptide substrate. The distribution
	of functional groups (functionality maps) on the substrate binding
	site allows for identification of modifications of the tetrapeptide
	sequence that are consistent with potent peptidic inhibitors. Furthermore,
	the best minima of benzene match corresponding moieties of an inhibitor

	ligase 1 and the W191G cavity mutant of cytochrome c peroxidase.
	The RCS improvements include its extension to virtual screening,
	more rigorous characterization of local and global binding effects,
	and methods to improve its computational efficiency by reducing the
	receptor ensemble to a representative set of configurations. The
	choice of receptor ensemble, its influence on the predictive power

	present drug-like inhibitors of a key enzyme in the editing machinery,

	a strategy employing molecular dynamics to account for protein flexibility.
	A virtual screen of the REL1 crystal structure against the National
	Cancer Institute Diversity Set was performed by using AutoDock4.
	The top 30 compounds, predicted to interact with REL1's ATP-binding
	pocket, were further refined by using the relaxed complex scheme
	(RCS), which redocks the compounds to receptor structures extracted
	from an explicitly solvated molecular dynamics trajectory. The resulting
	reordering of the ligands and filtering based on drug-like properties
	resulted in an initial recommended set of 8 ligands, 2 of which exhibited
	micromolar activity against REL1. A subsequent hierarchical similarity
	search with the most active compound over the full National Cancer
	Institute database and RCS rescoring resulted in an additional set
	of 6 ligands, 2 of which were confirmed as REL1 inhibitors with IC(50)
	values of approximately 1 microM. Tests of the 3 most promising compounds
	against the most closely related bacteriophage T4 RNA ligase 2, as

	In addition, the high-resolution crystal structure revealed several
	unique features of the active site, making this enzyme a promising
	target for structure-based drug design. In this work, two 20 ns atomistic

	dynamics of TbREL1, both with and without the ATP substrate present.
	The flexibility of the active site, dynamics of conserved residues

	of TbREL1's function. Differences in local and global motion upon

	a ligand and a macromolecular receptor. An understanding of the nature
	and role of each water molecule in the active site of a protein could
	greatly increase the efficiency of rational drug design approaches: if
	the propensity of a water molecule for displacement can be determined,
	then synthetic effort may be most profitably applied to the design
	of specific ligands with the displacement of this water molecule
	in mind. In this paper, a thermodynamic analysis of water molecules
	in the binding sites of six proteins, each complexed with a number
	of inhibitors, is presented. Two classes of water molecules were
	identified:  those conserved and not displaced by any of the ligands,
	and those that are displaced by some ligands. The absolute binding
	free energies of 54 water molecules were calculated using the double
	decoupling method, with replica exchange thermodynamic integration
	in Monte Carlo simulations. It was found that conserved water molecules
	are on average more tightly bound than displaced water molecules.
	In addition, Bayesian statistics is used to calculate the probability
	that a particular water molecule may be displaced by an appropriately
	designed ligand, given the calculated binding free energy of the
	water molecule. This approach therefore allows the numerical assessment
	of whether or not a given water molecule should be targeted for displacement
	as part of a rational drug design strategy.},

  abstract = {Successful design of potent and selective protein inhibitors, in terms
	of structure-based drug design, strongly relies on the correct understanding
	of the molecular features determining the ligand binding to the target
	protein. We present a case study of serine protease inhibitors with
	a bis(phenyl)methane moiety binding into the S3 pocket. These inhibitors
	bind with remarkable potency to the active site of thrombin, the
	blood coagulation factor IIa. A combination of X-ray crystallography
	and isothermal titration calorimetry provides conclusive insights
	into the driving forces responsible for the surprisingly high potency
	of these inhibitors. Analysis of six well-resolved crystal structures
	(resolution 1.58-2.25��) along with the thermodynamic data allows
	an explanation of the tight binding of the bis(phenyl)methane inhibitors.
	Interestingly, the two phenyl rings contribute to binding affinity
	for very different reasons -- a fact that can only be elucidated
	by a structure-based approach. The first phenyl moiety occupies the
	hydrophobic S3 pocket, resulting in a mainly entropic advantage of
	binding. This observation is based on the displacement of structural
	water molecules from the S3 pocket that are observed in complexes
	with inhibitors that do not bind in the S3 pocket. The same classic
	hydrophobic effect cannot explain the enhanced binding affinity resulting
	from the attachment of the second, more solvent-exposed phenyl ring.
	For the bis(phenyl)methane inhibitors, an observed adaptive rotation
	of a glutamate residue adjacent to the S3 binding pocket attracted
	our attention. The rotation of this glutamate into salt-bridging
	distance with a lysine moiety correlates with an enhanced enthalpic
	contribution to binding for these highly potent thrombin binders.
	This explanation for the magnitude of the attractive force is confirmed
	by data retrieved by a Relibase search of several thrombin-inhibitor
	complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank exhibiting similar molecular
	features. Special attention was attributed to putative changes in
	the protonation states of the interaction partners. For this purpose,
	two analogous inhibitors differing mainly in their potential to change
	the protonation state of a hydrogen-bond donor functionality were
	compared. Buffer dependencies of the binding enthalpy associated
	with complex formation could be traced by isothermal titration calorimetry,
	which revealed, along with analysis of the crystal structures (resolution
	1.60 and 1.75��), that a virtually compensating proton interchange
	between enzyme, inhibitor and buffer is responsible for the observed
	buffer-independent thermodynamic signatures.},

	Initially, the first simulation yielded results qualitatively similar

	50-150K higher than the experimental value of 315K. However, as the

	In our second REMD simulation, which starts from a nonnative conformation,

	simulations, despite the expected improvement in sampling of REMD

  abstract = {Protein-ligand binding occurs through interactions at the molecular
	surface. Hence, a proper description of this surface is essential
	to our understanding of the process of molecular recognition. Recent
	studies have noted the inadequacy of using a fixed 1.4 A solvent
	probe radius to generate the molecular surface. This assumes that
	water molecules approach all surface atoms at an equal distance irrespective
	of polarity, which is not the case. To adequately model the protein-water
	boundary requires that the solvent probe radius change according
	to the polarity of its contacting atoms, smaller near polar atoms
	and larger near apolar atoms. To our knowledge, no method currently
	exists to generate the molecular surface of a protein in this manner.
	Using a modification of the marching tetrahedra algorithm, we present
	a method to generate molecular surfaces using a variable radius solvent
	probe. The resulting surface lacks many of the unrealistic small
	crevices in nonpolar regions that are found when utilizing an invariant
	1.4 A solvent probe, while maintaining the fine detail of the surface
	at polar regions. On application of the method on a test set of 20
	protein structures taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), we also
	find far fewer empty unsolvated cavities that are present when using
	only a 1.4 A solvent probe, while the majority of solvated and polar
	cavities is retained. This suggests that the majority of empty cavities
	previously observed in protein structures might simply be artifacts
	of the surfacing method. We also find that the variable probe surface
	can have significant effects on electrostatic calculations by generating
	a better tuned description of the protein-water boundary. We also
	examined the binding interfaces of a diverse set of 55 protein-protein
	complexes. We find that using a variable probe results in an increase
	in perceived shape complementarity at these sites compared to using
	a 1.4 A solvent probe. The molecular volume and surface area are
	geometric values that determine various important properties for
	macromolecules, and the altered description afforded by a variable
	solvent probe molecular surface can have significant implications
	in protein recognition, energetics, folding, and stability calculations.},

  abstract = {Molecular recognition is central to all biological processes. For
	the past 50 years, Koshland's 'induced fit' hypothesis has been the
	textbook explanation for molecular recognition events. However, recent
	experimental evidence supports an alternative mechanism. 'Conformational
	selection' postulates that all protein conformations pre-exist, and
	the ligand selects the most favored conformation. Following binding
	the ensemble undergoes a population shift, redistributing the conformational
	states. Both conformational selection and induced fit appear to play
	roles. Following binding by a primary conformational selection event,
	optimization of side chain and backbone interactions is likely to
	proceed by an induced fit mechanism. Conformational selection has
	been observed for protein-ligand, protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA
	and RNA-ligand interactions. These data support a new molecular recognition
	paradigm for processes as diverse as signaling, catalysis, gene regulation
	and protein aggregation in disease, which has the potential to significantly

  abstract = {{The computation of absolute binding affinities by molecular dynamics
	(MD) based free energy simulations C, is analyzed, and an exact method
	to carry out such a computation is presented. The key to obtaining
	converged results is the introduction of suitable, auxiliary restraints
	to prevent the ligand from leaving the binding site when the native
	ligand-receptor interactions are turned off alchemically. We describe
	a versatile set of restraints that (i) can be used in MD simulations,
	that (ii) restricts both the position and the orientation of the
	ligand, and that (iii) is defined relative to the receptor rather
	than relative to a fixed point in space. The free energy cost. DeltaA(r),
	for this set of restraints can be evaluated analytically. Although
	the techniques were originally developed for the gas phase, the resulting
	expression is exact, since all contributions from solute-solvent
	interactions cancel from the final result. The value of DeltaA(r)
	depends only on the equilibrium values and force constants of the
	chosen harmonic restraint terms and, therefore, can be easily calculated.
	The standard state dependence of binding free energies is also investigated,
	and it is shown that the present approach takes this into account
	correctly. The analytical expression for DeltaA(r) is verified numerically
	by calculations on the complex formed by benzene with the L99A mutant
	of T4 lysozyme. The overall approach is illustrated by a complete
	binding free energy calculation for a complex based on a simplified
	model for tyrosine bound to tyrosyl-tRNA-synthetase. The results
	demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed set of restraints and
	confirm that the calculated binding free energy is independent of
	the details of the restraints. Comparisons are made with earlier
	formulations for the calculation of binding free energies, and certain
	limitations of that work are described. The relationship between
	DeltaA(r) and the loss of translational and rotational entropy during
	a binding process is analyzed.}},

	provide a rigorous means to combine information from multiple sources

	high dimensional and rugged free energy landscape of a molecular

	The average RMS error in the relative free energy prediction was
	2.5 kcal/mol (phenol) and 1.1 kcal/mol (catechol). To understand

	structures for nine of the diverse ligands and for all six phenol
	analogs. The average RMSD of the predicted pose to the experiment
	was 2.0 A (diverse set), 1.8 A (phenol-derived predictions), and

	from Bacillus megaterium (CYP102A1) with its flexible and widely
	opened active site is still not well understood. In the present work
	(-)-alpha-pinene bound complexes with two triple mutants were modeled
	to elucidate the contribution of the three major factors that mediate
	selectivity: active site shape, protein flexibility, and chemical
	reactivity of the substrate. For the triple mutant A74G F87V L188Q
	(GVQ), one stable, productive conformation of the substrate (conformation
	I) was identified by multiple molecular dynamics simulations. The
	model predicts pinene epoxide as a major product (42\% pinene oxide,
	23\% verbenol) which is in agreement with the experimental product
	profile (70\% pinene oxide, 20\% verbenol). In contrast, for the
	triple mutant A74G F87G L188Q (GGQ) two stable productive substrate
	conformations were identified (conformations IIa and IIb), and verbenol
	was predicted as major product (81\% verbenol, 16\% myrtenol), which
	is in agreement with experimental results (77\% verbenol, 10\% myrtenol).
	The effect of chemical reactivity of the substrate was demonstrated
	by comparison of (-)-alpha-pinene to its regioisomer (-)-beta-pinene,
	where the product profile is shifted from 68\% pinocarveol and 32\%
	myrtanal in mutant GVQ, to 40\% pinocarveol and 60\% myrtanal in

  abstract = {The ferric spin state equilibrium of the heme iron was analyzed in
	wild-type cytochrome P450 BM3 and its F87G mutant by using temperature
	(T)-jump relaxation spectroscopy in combination with static equilibrium
	experiments. No relaxation process was measurable in the substrate-free
	enzyme indicating a relaxation process with a rate constant>10,000
	s(-1). In contrast, a slow spin state transition process was observed
	in the N-palmitoylglycine (NPG)-bound enzyme species. This transition
	occurred with an observed rate constant (298 K) of approximately
	800 s(-1) in the wild-type, and approximately 2500 s(-1) in the F87G
	mutant, suggesting a significant contribution of the phenylalanine
	side chain to a reaction step rate limiting the actual spin state
	transition. These findings are discussed in terms of an equilibrium
	between different binding modes of the substrate, including a position
	7.5 A away from the heme iron ("distal") and the catalytically relevant
	"proximal" binding site, and are in accordance with results from
	X-ray crystallography, NMR studies, and molecular dynamics simulations.},

	Mode Integration method show that, although it is computationally
	demanding, it can be less accurate than the pure harmonic approximation.
	The inaccuracy of Mode Integration is traceable to its use of a Cartesian
	coordinate basis set; much more accurate results are obtained when
	the basis set consists of bond-angle-torsion coordinates.},

  abstract = {The restriction of a small molecule's motion on binding to a protein
	causes a loss of configurational entropy, and thus a penalty in binding
	affinity. Some energy models used in computer-aided ligand design
	neglect this entropic penalty, whereas others account for it based
	on an expected drop in the number of accessible rotamers upon binding.
	However, the validity of the physical assumptions underlying the
	various approaches is largely unexamined. The present study addresses
	this issue by using Mining Minima calculations to analyze the association
	of amprenavir with HIV protease. The computed loss in ligand configurational
	entropy is large, contributing approximately 25 kcal/mol (4.184 kJ/kcal)
	to DeltaG degrees. Most of this loss results from narrower energy
	wells in the bound state, rather than a drop in the number of accessible
	rotamers. Coupling among rotation/translation and internal degrees
	of freedom complicates the decomposition of the entropy change into
	additive terms. The results highlight the potential to gain affinity
	by designing conformationally restricted ligands and have implications
	for the formulation of energy models for ligand scoring.},

	an electrostatic free energy functional is constructed that depends
	solely on the local ionic concentrations. The unique set of such
	concentrations that minimize this free energy are given by the usual
	Boltzmann distributions through the electrostatic potential which
	is determined by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. This approach is
	then applied to the variational implicit solvent description of the

	taken for the singularities of the potential generated by the solute
	point charges. The variation of the electrostatic free energy with
	respect to the location change of solute-solvent interfaces, that
	is, dielectric boundaries, is derived. Such a variation gives rise
	to the normal component of the effective surface force per unit surface
	area that is shown to be attractive to the fixed point charges in
	the solutes. Two examples of applications are given to validate the
	analytical results. The first one is a one-dimensional model system
	resembling, for example, a charged solute or cavity in a one-dimensional
	channel. The second one, which is of its own interest, is the electrostatic
	free energy of a charged spherical solute immersed in an ionic solution.
	An analytical formula is derived for the Debye-Hückel approximation
	of the free energy, extending the classical Born's formula to one
	that includes ionic concentrations. Variations of the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann

	the mean solute internal energies (determined with the Cornell et

	evolution is thus an energy minimizing process, and the equilibrium

  abstract = {Methods to compute free energy differences between different states
	of a molecular system are reviewed with the aim of identifying their
	basic ingredients and their utility when applied in practice to biomolecular
	systems. A free energy calculation is comprised of three basic components:
	(i) a suitable model or Hamiltonian, (ii) a sampling protocol with
	which one can generate a representative ensemble of molecular configurations,
	and (iii) an estimator of the free energy difference itself. Alternative
	sampling protocols can be distinguished according to whether one
	or more states are to be sampled. In cases where only a single state
	is considered, six alternative techniques could be distinguished:
	(i) changing the dynamics, (ii) deforming the energy surface, (iii)
	extending the dimensionality, (iv) perturbing the forces, (v) reducing
	the number of degrees of freedom, and (vi) multi-copy approaches.
	In cases where multiple states are to be sampled, the three primary
	techniques are staging, importance sampling, and adiabatic decoupling.
	Estimators of the free energy can be classified as global methods
	that either count the number of times a given state is sampled or
	use energy differences. Or, they can be classified as local methods
	that either make use of the force or are based on transition probabilities.
	Finally, this overview of the available techniques and how they can
	be best used in a practical context is aimed at helping the reader
	choose the most appropriate combination of approaches for the biomolecular

	in a consistent fashion with biological data. In the unique beta-hydroxyacyl-ACP
	dehydratase of Plasmodium falciparum (PfFabZ), the application of
	standard molecular docking and MD simulations was partially sufficient
	to shed light on the activity of previously discovered inhibitors.
	Complementing docking results with atomistic simulations in the steered
	molecular dynamics (SMD) framework, we devised an in silico approach
	to study molecular interactions and to compare the binding characteristics
	of ligand analogues. We hypothesized an interaction model that both
	explained the biological activity of known ligands, and provided
	insight into designing novel enzyme inhibitors. Mimicking single-molecule
	pulling experiments, we used SMD-derived force profiles to discern
	active from inactive compounds for the first time. A new compound
	was designed and its biological activity toward the PfFabZ enzyme
	predicted. Finally, the computational predictions were experimentally
	confirmed, highlighting the robustness of the drug design approach

	and may be very conveniently run on desktop computers using distributed
	computing software. In recent years there has been a proliferation
	of NE methods, but these approaches have barely, if at all, been
	used in the context of calculating protein-ligand binding free energies.
	In a recent study by these authors, different combinations of NE
	methods with various test systems were compared and protocols identified
	which yielded results as accurate as replica exchange thermodynamic
	integration (RETI). The NE approaches, however, lend themselves to
	extensive parallelization through the use of distributed computing.
	Here the best performing of those NE protocols, a replica exchange
	method using Bennett's acceptance ratio as the free energy estimator
	(RENE), is applied to two sets of congeneric inhibitors bound to
	neuraminidase and cyclooxygenase-2. These protein-ligand systems
	were originally studied with RETI, giving results to which NE and
	RENE simulations are compared. These NE calculations were carried
	out on a large, highly distributed group of low-performance desktop
	computers which are part of a Condor pool. RENE was found to produce
	results of a predictive quality at least as good as RETI in less
	than half the wall clock time. However, non-RE NE results were found
	to be far less predictive. In addition, the RENE method successfully
	identified a localized region of rapidly changing free energy gradients
	without the need for prior investigation. These results suggest that
	the RENE protocol is appropriate for use in the context of predicting
	protein-ligand binding free energies and that it can offer advantages
	over conventional, equilibrium approaches.},

  year = {2009},
  volume = {3},
  pages = {21},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The architectural structure of cellular networks provides
	a framework for innovations as well as constraints for protein evolution.
	This issue has previously been studied extensively by analyzing protein
	interaction networks. However, it is unclear how signaling networks
	influence and constrain protein evolution and conversely, how protein
	evolution modifies and shapes the functional consequences of signaling
	networks. In this study, we constructed a human signaling network
	containing more than 1,600 nodes and 5,000 links through manual curation
	of signaling pathways, and analyzed the dN/dS values of human-mouse
	orthologues on the network. RESULTS: We revealed that the protein
	dN/dS value decreases along the signal information flow from the
	extracellular space to nucleus. In the network, neighbor proteins
	tend to have similar dN/dS ratios, indicating neighbor proteins have
	similar evolutionary rates: co-fast or co-slow. However, different
	types of relationships (activating, inhibitory and neutral) between
	proteins have different effects on protein evolutionary rates, i.e.,
	physically interacting protein pairs have the closest evolutionary
	rates. Furthermore, for directed shortest paths, the more distant
	two proteins are, the less chance they share similar evolutionary
	rates. However, such behavior was not observed for neutral shortest
	paths. Fast evolving signaling proteins have two modes of evolution:
	immunological proteins evolve more independently, while apoptotic
	proteins tend to form network components with other signaling proteins
	and share more similar evolutionary rates, possibly enhancing rapid
	information exchange between apoptotic and other signaling pathways.
	CONCLUSION: Major network constraints on protein evolution in protein
	interaction networks previously described have been found for signaling
	networks. We further uncovered how network characteristics affect
	the evolutionary and co-evolutionary behavior of proteins and how
	protein evolution can modify the existing functionalities of signaling
	networks. These new insights provide some general principles for
	understanding protein evolution in the context of signaling networks.},

	virtual alanine-scanning consensus predictions over three different

	as the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA)
	and solvated interaction energy (SIE) to the molecular dynamics (MD)
	trajectories for mutated and wild-type complexes. Here, predicted
	hot-spot residues were actually mutated to alanine, and crystal structures
	of the mutated complexes were determined. Two mutated MP1-p14 complexes
	were investigated, the p14(Y56A)-mutated complex and the MP1(L63A,L65A)-mutated
	complex. Alternative ways to generate MD ensembles for mutant complexes,
	not relying on crystal structures for mutated complexes, were also
	investigated. The SIE function, fitted on protein-ligand binding
	affinities, gave absolute binding affinity predictions in excellent
	agreement with experiment and outperformed standard MM-GBSA predictions
	when tested on the MD ensembles of Ras-Raf and Ras-RalGDS protein-protein
	complexes. For wild-type and mutant MP1-p14 complexes, SIE predictions
	of relative binding affinities were supported by a yeast two-hybrid
	assay that provided semiquantitative relative interaction strengths.
	Results on the MP1-mutated complex suggested that SIE predictions
	deteriorate if mutant MD ensembles are approximated by just mutating
	the wild-type MD trajectory. The SIE data on the p14-mutated complex
	indicated feasibility for generating mutant MD ensembles from mutated
	wild-type crystal structure, despite local structural differences
	observed upon mutation. For energetic considerations, this would
	circumvent costly needs to produce and crystallize mutated complexes.
	The sensitized protein-protein interface afforded by the p14(Y56A)
	mutation identified here has practical applications in screening-based
	discovery of first-generation small-molecule hits for further development

  abstract = {In free energy calculations based on thermodynamic integration, it
	is necessary to compute the derivatives of the free energy as a function
	of one (scalar case) or several (vector case) order parameters. We
	derive in a compact way a general formulation for evaluating these
	derivatives as the average of a mean force acting on the order parameters,
	which involves first derivatives with respect to both Cartesian coordinates
	and time. This is in contrast with the previously derived formulas,
	which require first and second derivatives of the order parameter
	with respect to Cartesian coordinates. As illustrated in a concrete
	example, the main advantage of this new formulation is the simplicity
	of its use, especially for complicated order parameters. It is also
	straightforward to implement in a molecular dynamics code, as can
	be seen from the pseudocode given at the end. We further discuss
	how the approach based on time derivatives can be combined with the
	adaptive biasing force method, an enhanced sampling technique that
	rapidly yields uniform sampling of the order parameters, and by doing
	so greatly improves the efficiency of free energy calculations. Using
	the backbone dihedral angles Phi and Psi in N-acetylalanyl-N'-methylamide
	as a numerical example, we present a technique to reconstruct the
	free energy from its derivatives, a calculation that presents some
	difficulties in the vector case because of the statistical errors

	inhibitor (NNRTI) that is highly effective in treating wild-type

	low doses ( approximately 25-75 mg/day). We have determined the structure
	of wild-type HIV-1 RT complexed with TMC278 at 1.8 A resolution,
	using an RT crystal form engineered by systematic RT mutagenesis.
	This high-resolution structure reveals that the cyanovinyl group
	of TMC278 is positioned in a hydrophobic tunnel connecting the NNRTI-binding
	pocket to the nucleic acid-binding cleft. The crystal structures
	of TMC278 in complexes with the double mutant K103N/Y181C (2.1 A)
	and L100I/K103N HIV-1 RTs (2.9 A) demonstrated that TMC278 adapts
	to bind mutant RTs. In the K103N/Y181C RT/TMC278 structure, loss
	of the aromatic ring interaction caused by the Y181C mutation is
	counterbalanced by interactions between the cyanovinyl group of TMC278
	and the aromatic side chain of Y183, which is facilitated by an approximately
	1.5 A shift of the conserved Y(183)MDD motif. In the L100I/K103N
	RT/TMC278 structure, the binding mode of TMC278 is significantly
	altered so that the drug conforms to changes in the binding pocket
	primarily caused by the L100I mutation. The flexible binding pocket
	acts as a molecular "shrink wrap" that makes a shape complementary
	to the optimized TMC278 in wild-type and drug-resistant forms of
	HIV-1 RT. The crystal structures provide a better understanding of
	how the flexibility of an inhibitor can compensate for drug-resistance

	adapt to changes in the NNRTI-binding pocket in several ways: (1).
	DAPY analogues can bind in at least two conformationally distinct
	modes; (2). within a given binding mode, torsional flexibility ("wiggling")
	of DAPY analogues permits access to numerous conformational variants;
	and (3). the compact design of the DAPY analogues permits significant

	The complexes of these ligands with the Grb2 SH2 domain were examined

  abstract = {Substrate binding to cytochrome P450cam is generally considered to
	be a two-step process. The first step corresponds to the entrance
	of the substrate, camphor, into the heme pocket. The second step
	corresponds to a spin transition (low spin-->high spin) of the iron
	in the protein-substrate complex. This spin transition is related
	to the mobility of the substrate inside the active site [Biochim
	Biophys Acta 1338 (1997) 77]. Potassium cations (K(+)) have a specific
	effect on the spin equilibrium. This is generally attributed to the
	K(+) ion-induced conformational change of tyrosine 96, the hydroxyl
	group of which is hydrogen bonded to the keto group of camphor and
	results in optimum substrate orientation and reduced mobility of
	this substrate in the active site. In the present paper, we show
	that K(+) not only affects the substrate-Tyr 96 couple, but acts
	more globally since K(+) effects are also observed in the Tyr96Phe
	mutant as well as in complexes with camphor-analogues. Large compounds,
	that fit well in the heme pocket and bind with higher affinity than
	camphor, display high spin contents that are less dependent on the
	presence of K(+). In contrast, K(+) has a significant effect on the
	high spin content of substrate-cytochrome P450cam complexes with
	looser interactions. We conclude that large compounds with higher
	affinities than camphor have more van der Waals contacts with the
	active site residues. Their mobilities are then reduced and less
	dependent on the presence of K(+). In this study, we also explored,
	for comparison, the K(+) effect on the spin transition state of another
	member of the P450 superfamily, cytochrome P450lin. This effect is
	not as strong as those observed for cytochrome P450cam. Even though
	the spin equilibrium does not change dramatically in the presence
	of K(+) or Na(+), the value of the dissociation constant (K(d)) for

	Although it generally proved rather difficult to predict the absolute

	analyze the affinities of charged peptides, where it is required

	can create cavities in the core of a protein (our unpublished results).
	The sizes and shapes of such cavities can vary substantially depending
	on factors such as local geometry, whether or not a cavity already
	exists at the site of substitution, and the degree to which the protein
	structure relaxes to occupy the space vacated by the substituted
	residue. We show by crystallographic and thermodynamic analysis that

	the melting temperature of the protein by 6.0 degrees C at pH 3.0.
	Benzene does not, however, bind to the cavity created by the Phe
	153----Ala replacement. The results show that cavities can be engineered

	specific ligands. The binding of benzene at an internal site 7 A

  abstract = {The ribonuclease H (RNase H) domain on the p66 monomer of HIV-1 reverse
	transcriptase enzyme has become a target for inhibition. The active
	site is one potential binding site, but other RNase H sites can accommodate
	inhibitors. Using a combination of experimental and computational
	studies, potential new binding sites and binding modes have been
	identified. Libraries of compounds were screened with an experimental
	assay to identify actives without knowledge of the binding site.
	The compounds were computationally docked at putative binding sites.
	Based on positive enrichment of natural-product actives relative
	to the database of compounds, we propose that many inhibitors bind
	to an alternative, potentially allosteric, site centered on Q507
	of p66. For a series of hydrazone compounds, a small amount of positive
	enrichment was obtained when active compounds were bound by induced-fit
	docking at the interface between the DNA:RNA substrate and the RNase
	H domain near residue Q500.},

  abstract = {Protein conformational change is an important consideration in ligand-docking
	screens, but it is difficult to predict. A simple way to account
	for protein flexibility is to soften the criterion for steric fit
	between ligand and receptor. A more comprehensive but more expensive
	method would be to sample multiple receptor conformations explicitly.
	Here, these two approaches are compared. A "soft" scoring function
	was created by attenuating the repulsive term in the Lennard-Jones
	potential, allowing for a closer approach between ligand and protein.
	The standard, "hard" Lennard-Jones potential was used for docking
	to multiple receptor conformations. The Available Chemicals Directory
	(ACD) was screened against two cavity sites in the T4 lysozyme. These
	sites undergo small but significant conformational changes on ligand
	binding, making them good systems for soft docking. The ACD was also
	screened against the drug target aldose reductase, which can undergo
	large conformational changes on ligand binding. We evaluated the
	ability of the scoring functions to identify known ligands from among
	the over 200 000 decoy molecules in the database. The soft potential
	was always better at identifying known ligands than the hard scoring
	function when only a single receptor conformation was used. Conversely,
	the soft function was worse at identifying known leads than the hard
	function when multiple receptor conformations were used. This was
	true even for the cavity sites and was especially true for aldose
	reductase. To test the multiple-conformation method predictively,
	we screened the ACD for molecules that preferentially docked to the
	expanded conformation of aldose reductase, known to bind larger ligands.
	Six novel molecules that ranked among the top 0.66\% of hits from
	the multiple-conformation calculation, but ranked relatively poorly
	in the soft docking calculation, were tested experimentally for enzyme
	inhibition. Four of these six inhibited the enzyme, the best with
	an IC(50) of 8 microM. Although ligands can get better scores in
	soft docking, the same is also true for decoys. The improved ranking
	of such decoys can come at the expense of true ligands.},

	of general interest to medicinal chemistry, as well as to the broader
	field of molecular recognition. The ability to predict computationally
	the thermodynamics of these molecular recognition processes has been
	relatively weak until recently, however, continued developments on
	several fronts are extending the scope of applicability of these
	methods. The rapid growth in the number of protein-ligand structures
	has initially led to the development of a range of empirical scoring
	functions based on relatively simple descriptions of intermolecular
	interactions. These methods have had some success in ranking binding
	affinities when tuned to particular protein systems or in rather
	qualitative estimates of molecular fit in fast docking calculations.
	However, they are too unreliable for more detailed, quantitative,
	assessment and comparison of binding affinities. Physics-based free
	energy calculations are in principle more general and have the potential
	to be significantly more accurate. These approaches have seen steady
	development over many years and rely on carefully calibrated molecular
	energy functions (force-fields), simulations of the systems with
	explicit solvent, and the coming-of-age of continuum solvation models.
	In addition to the initially developped Free Energy Perturbation
	(FEP) and Thermodynamic Integration (TI) methods, new approaches
	include the Molecular Mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA)
	and the Linear Interaction Energy (LIE) approaches. This review concentrates
	on MM-PBSA and LIE, and their variants. The routine application of
	these calculations is becoming possible because of enhanced computational
	hardware and the development of a range of computational chemistry
	tools. This review addresses: i) the basic principles behind free
	energy calculations ii) recent methodological advances iii) comparisons
	of predicted and experimentally determined affinities iv) the uncertainties
	and limitations of both the computational and experimental data v)
	areas where progress can be made vi) the practicality of applying

  abstract = {This paper describes a methodology to calculate the binding free energy
	(delta G) of a protein-ligand complex using a continuum model of
	the solvent. A formal thermodynamic cycle is used to decompose the
	binding free energy into electrostatic and non-electrostatic contributions.
	In this cycle, the reactants are discharged in water, associated
	as purely nonpolar entities, and the final complex is then recharged.
	The total electrostatic free energies of the protein, the ligand,
	and the complex in water are calculated with the finite difference
	Poisson-Boltzmann (FDPB) method. The nonpolar (hydrophobic) binding
	free energy is calculated using a free energy-surface area relationship,
	with a single alkane/water surface tension coefficient (gamma aw).
	The loss in backbone and side-chain configurational entropy upon
	binding is estimated and added to the electrostatic and the nonpolar
	components of delta G. The methodology is applied to the binding
	of the murine MHC class I protein H-2Kb with three distinct peptides,
	and to the human MHC class I protein HLA-A2 in complex with five
	different peptides. Despite significant differences in the amino
	acid sequences of the different peptides, the experimental binding
	free energy differences (delta delta Gexp) are quite small (< 0.3
	and < 2.7 kcal/mol for the H-2Kb and HLA-A2 complexes, respectively).
	For each protein, the calculations are successful in reproducing
	a fairly small range of values for delta delta Gcalc (< 4.4 and <
	5.2 kcal/mol, respectively) although the relative peptide binding
	affinities of H-2Kb and HLA-A2 are not reproduced. For all protein-peptide
	complexes that were treated, it was found that electrostatic interactions
	oppose binding whereas nonpolar interactions drive complex formation.
	The two types of interactions appear to be correlated in that larger
	nonpolar contributions to binding are generally opposed by increased
	electrostatic contributions favoring dissociation. The factors that
	drive the binding of peptides to MHC proteins are discussed in light
	of our results.},

  abstract = {The binding energy distribution analysis method (BEDAM) for the computation
	of receptor−ligand standard binding free energies with implicit solvation
	is presented. The method is based on a well-established statistical
	mechanics theory of molecular association. It is shown that, in the
	context of implicit solvation, the theory is homologous to the test
	particle method of solvation thermodynamics with the solute−solvent
	potential represented by the effective binding energy of the protein−ligand
	complex. Accordingly, in BEDAM the binding constant is computed by
	means of a weighted integral of the probability distribution of the
	binding energy obtained in the canonical ensemble in which the ligand
	is positioned in the binding site but the receptor and the ligand
	interact only with the solvent continuum. It is shown that the binding
	energy distribution encodes all of the physical effects of binding.
	The balance between binding enthalpy and entropy is seen in our formalism
	as a balance between favorable and unfavorable binding modes which
	are coupled through the normalization of the binding energy distribution
	function. An efficient computational protocol for the binding energy
	distribution based on the AGBNP2 implicit solvent model, parallel
	Hamiltonian replica exchange sampling, and histogram reweighting
	is developed. Applications of the method to a set of known binders
	and nonbinders of the L99A and L99A/M102Q mutants of T4 lysozyme
	receptor are illustrated. The method is able to discriminate without
	error binders from nonbinders, and the computed standard binding
	free energies of the binders are found to be in good agreement with
	experimental measurements. Analysis of the results reveals that the
	binding affinities of these systems reflect the contributions from
	multiple conformations spanning a wide range of binding energies.},

  abstract = {The AGBNP2 implicit solvent model, an evolution of the Analytical
	Generalized Born plus NonPolar (AGBNP) model we have previously reported,
	is presented with the aim of modeling hydration effects beyond those

	new empirical hydration free energy component based on a procedure
	to locate and score hydration sites on the solute surface is introduced
	to model first solvation shell effects, such as hydrogen bonding,
	which are poorly described by continuum dielectric models. This new
	component is added to the generalized Born and nonpolar AGBNP terms.
	Also newly introduced is an analytical Solvent Excluded Volume (SEV)
	model which improves the solute volume description by reducing the
	effect of spurious high dielectric interstitial spaces present in
	conventional van der Waals representations. The AGBNP2 model is parametrized
	and tested with respect to experimental hydration free energies of
	small molecules and the results of explicit solvent simulations.
	Modeling the granularity of water is one of the main design principles
	employed for the first shell solvation function and the SEV model,
	by requiring that water locations have a minimum available volume
	based on the size of a water molecule. It is shown that the new volumetric
	model produces Born radii and surface areas in good agreement with
	accurate numerical evaluations of these quantities. The results of

	drug discovery. Success depends on the quality of the docking scoring
	function, among other factors. An imperfect scoring function can
	mislead by predicting incorrect ligand geometries or by selecting
	nonbinding molecules over true ligands. These false-positive hits
	may be considered "decoys". Although these decoys are frustrating,
	they potentially provide important tests for a docking algorithm;
	the more subtle the decoy, the more rigorous the test. Indeed, decoy
	databases have been used to improve protein structure prediction
	algorithms and protein-protein docking algorithms. Here, we describe
	20 geometric decoys in five enzymes and 166 "hit list" decoys-i.e.,
	molecules predicted to bind by our docking program that were tested
	and found not to do so-for beta-lactamase and two cavity sites in
	lysozyme. Especially in the cavity sites, which are very simple,
	these decoys highlight particular weaknesses in our scoring function.
	We also consider the performance of five other widely used docking
	scoring functions against our geometric and hit list decoys. Intriguingly,
	whereas many of these other scoring functions performed better on
	the geometric decoys, they typically performed worse on the hit list
	decoys, often highly ranking molecules that seemed to poorly complement
	the model sites. Several of these "hits"from the other scoring functions
	were tested experimentally and found, in fact, to be decoys. Collectively,
	these decoys provide a tool for the development and improvement of
	molecular docking scoring functions. Such improvements may, in turn,
	be rapidly tested experimentally against these and related experimental
	systems, which are well-behaved in assays and for structure determination.},

  abstract = {Determining protein-small molecule binding affinity is a key component
	of present-day rational drug discovery. To circumvent the time, labor,
	and materials costs associated with experimental protein-small molecule
	binding assays, a variety of structure-based computational methods
	have been developed for determining protein-small molecule binding
	affinities. These methods can be placed in one of two classes: accurate
	but slow (Class 1), and fast but approximate (Class 2). Class 1 methods,
	which explicitly take into account protein flexibility and include
	an atomic-level description of solvation, are capable of quantitatively
	reproducing experimental protein-small molecule absolute binding
	free energies. However, Class 1 computational requirements make screening
	thousands to millions of small molecules against a protein, as required
	for rational drug design, infeasible for the foreseeable future.
	Class 2 methods, on the contrary, are sufficiently fast to perform
	such inhibitor screening, yet they suffer from limited descriptions
	of protein flexibility and solvation, which in turn limit their ability
	to select and rank-order small molecules by computed binding affinities.
	This review presents an overview of Class 1 and Class 2 methods,
	and avenues of research in Class 2 methods aimed at bringing them
	closer to Class 1 accuracy.},

	Recent studies have identified many exceptions to the widely held
	view that signal sequences are simple, degenerate and interchangeable.
	Growing evidence indicates that signal sequences contain information
	that specifies the choice of targeting pathway, the efficiency of
	translocation, the timing of cleavage and even postcleavage functions.
	As a consequence, signal sequences can have important roles in modulating
	protein biogenesis. Based on a synthesis of studies in numerous experimental

	it has been known that ligand binding induces large conformational
	changes in the protease, the dynamic aspects of binding have been
	largely ignored. Several computational models describing protease
	dynamics have been reported recently. These have reproduced experimental
	observations, and have also explained how ligands gain access to
	the binding site through dynamic behavior of the protease. Specifically,
	the transitions between three different conformations of the protein
	have been modeled in atomic detail. Two of these forms were determined
	by crystallography, and the third was implied by NMR experiments.
	Based on these computational models, it has been suggested that binding
	of inhibitors in allosteric sites might affect protease flexibility
	and disrupt its function.},

	step perturbation method (ES-OS) to tackle this problem in a highly
	efficient way. A single molecular dynamics simulation of a judiciously
	chosen reference state (using two sets of soft-core interactions)
	is sufficient to determine conformational distributions of chemically
	similar compounds and the free energy differences between them. The
	ES-OS method is applied to a set of five biologically relevant 8-substituted
	GTP analogs having high energy barriers between the anti and the
	syn conformations of the base with respect to the ribose part. The
	reliability of ES-OS is verified by comparing the results to Hamiltonian
	replica exchange simulations of GTP and 8-Br-GTP and the experimentally
	determined 3J(C4,H1') coupling constant for GMP in water. Additional
	simulations in vacuum and octanol allow us to calculate differences
	in the solvation free energies and in lipophilicities (log P). Free
	energy contributions from individual conformational regions are also
	calculated, and their relationship with the overall free energy is
	derived leading to a set of multiconformational free energy formulas.
	These relationships are of general applicability and can be used
	in free energy calculations for a more diverse set of compounds.},

  abstract = {To overcome the problem of insufficient conformational sampling within
	biomolecular simulations, we have developed a novel Hamiltonian replica
	exchange molecular dynamics (H-REMD) scheme that uses soft-core interactions
	between those parts of the system that contribute most to high energy
	barriers. The advantage of this approach over other H-REMD schemes
	is the possibility to use a relatively small number of replicas with
	locally larger differences between the individual Hamiltonians. Because
	soft-core potentials are almost the same as regular ones at longer
	distances, most of the interactions between atoms of perturbed parts
	will only be slightly changed. Rather, the strong repulsion between
	atoms that are close in space, which in many cases results in high
	energy barriers, is weakened within higher replicas of our proposed
	scheme. In addition to the soft-core interactions, we proposed to
	include multiple replicas using the same Hamiltonian/level of softness.
	We have tested the new protocol on the GTP and 8-Br-GTP molecules,
	which are known to have high energy barriers between the anti and
	syn conformation of the base with respect to the sugar moiety. During
	two 25 ns MD simulations of both systems the transition from the
	more stable to the less stable (but still experimentally observed)
	conformation is not seen at all. Also temperature REMD over 50 replicas
	for 1 ns did not show any transition at room temperature. On the
	other hand, more than 20 of such transitions are observed in H-REMD
	using six replicas (at three different Hamiltonians) during 6.8 ns
	per replica for GTP and 12 replicas (at six different Hamiltonians)
	during 8.7 ns per replica for 8-Br-GTP. The large increase in sampling
	efficiency was obtained from an optimized H-REMD scheme involving
	soft-core potentials, with multiple simulations using the same level
	of softness. The optimization of the scheme was performed by fast
	mimicking [J. Hritz and C. Oostenbrink, J. Chem. Phys. 127, 204104
	(2007)].},

  abstract = {Cytochrome P450BM3 (CYP102A1) from Bacillus megaterium, a fatty acid
	hydroxylase, is a member of a very large superfamily of monooxygenase
	enzymes. The available crystal structures of the enzyme show non-productive
	binding of substrates with their omega-end distant from the iron
	in a hydrophobic pocket at one side of the active site. We have constructed
	and characterised mutants in which this pocket is filled by large
	hydrophobic side-chains replacing alanine at position 82. The mutants
	having phenylalanine or tryptophan at this position have very much
	(approximately 800-fold) greater affinity for substrate, with a greater
	conversion of the haem iron to the high-spin state, and similarly
	increased catalytic efficiency. The enzyme as isolated contains bound
	palmitate, reflecting this much higher affinity. We have determined
	the crystal structure of the haem domain of the Ala82Phe mutant with
	bound palmitate; this shows that the substrate is binding differently
	from the wild-type enzyme but still distant from the haem iron. Detailed
	analysis of the structure indicates that the tighter binding in the
	mutant reflects a shift in the conformational equilibrium of the
	substrate-free enzyme towards the conformation seen in the substrate
	complex rather than differences in the enzyme-substrate interactions.
	On this basis, we outline a sequence of events for the initial stages
	of the catalytic cycle. The Ala82Phe and Ala82Trp mutants are also
	very much more effective catalysts of indole hydroxylation than the
	wild-type enzyme, suggesting that they will be valuable starting
	points for the design of mutants to catalyse synthetically useful

  abstract = {FK506 is a naturally occurring immunosuppressant whose mode of action
	involves formation of an initial complex with the cytosolic protein
	FKBP12. The composite surface of this complex then binds to and inhibits
	the protein phosphatase calcineurin (PP2B). To investigate why FK506
	does not inhibit calcineurin directly we have conducted molecular
	modeling and conformational studies on published structures of FK506
	both alone and in complex with FKBP12. From studies of the structure
	of FK506 in CDCl3 and Z-Arg32-ascomycin in water (a water soluble
	analogue of FK506) we suggest that the FK506 molecule can be viewed
	as consisting of three separate regions. The pipecolate region which
	extends from C24 to C10 including the pipecolate ring shows strongly
	conserved conformation in both solvents. The loop region which extends
	from C25 to C16 shows general conservation of the loop structure
	and the pyranose region made up of the pyranose ring and C15-C17
	which shows highly variable conformation depending on solvent. Comparison
	of the structure of Z-Arg32-ascomycin in water with structures of
	FK506 bound to FKBP12 indicate that the conformation of the pipecolate
	region is conserved during the binding process. The conformation
	of the loop region was generally conserved but a significant reduction
	(approximately 1.7 A) in the diameter of the loop in the bound structure
	was observed. The conformation of the pyranose ring and C15-C17 region
	was found to be significantly altered in the bound structure resulting
	in displacements of the C13 and C15 methoxyl groups of 2.8 and 3.5
	A, respectively. From computer models and molecular dynamics simulations
	of interactions between FK506 and FKBP12 we suggest that the conformational
	changes observed in bound FK506 are induced by the interaction between
	the 80's loop of FKBP12 and the pyranose ring of FKBP12. These interactions
	result in the formation of a complex with the both correct shape
	and surface polarity for interaction with calcineurin.},

  abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibition
	is a major focus of current anti-AIDS drug discovery and development
	programs, comprising 17 of the 31 Food and Drug Administration-approved
	compounds. The emergence of the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI)
	class of compounds provides a highly specific and structurally diverse
	set of drugs, which act noncompetitively to perturb normal RT function.
	Despite a relatively rich set of crystallographic data of RT in various
	states, details of the allosteric modulation of RT dynamics by NNRTIs
	are lacking. Capturing this inhibitory mechanism could fuel the design
	of more effective inhibitors at the NNRTI site and also drive the
	identification of novel allosteric sites. To address this, we have
	performed multicopy molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of RT in
	the presence and absence of the NNRTI nevirapine (cumulative total
	simulation time, 360�ns). By comparing the collective motions of
	the MD and crystallographic structures, we demonstrate that the chief
	effect of NNRTIs is to constrain a key rigid-body motion between
	the "fingers" and "thumb" subdomains of the p66 subunit. We show
	that the NNRTI binding pocket (NNIBP) is proximal to the hinge points
	for this essential motion, and NNRTIs therefore act as "molecular
	wedges," sterically blocking the full range of motion. To explain
	how this impaired movement might result in the experimentally observed
	loss of polymerase activity, we show that the motion influences the
	geometry of key catalytic residues on opposite faces of the NNIBP.
	From a methodological point of view, our results suggest that the
	multicopy MD simulation approach is very useful when studying proteins
	that perform such large conformational changes.},

  abstract = {Free Energy Perturbation with Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics
	(FEP/REMD) offers a powerful strategy to improve the convergence
	of free energy computations. In particular, it has been shown previously
	that a FEP/REMD scheme allowing random moves within an extended replica
	ensemble of thermodynamic coupling parameters “λ” can improve the
	statistical convergence in calculations of absolute binding free
	energy of ligands to proteins [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2009, 5, 2583].
	In the present study, FEP/REMD is extended and combined with an accelerated
	MD simulations method based on Hamiltonian replica-exchange MD (H-REMD)
	to overcome the additional problems arising from the existence of
	kinetically trapped conformations within the protein receptor. In
	the combined strategy, each system with a given thermodynamic coupling
	factor λ in the extended ensemble is further coupled with a set of
	replicas evolving on a biased energy surface with boosting potentials
	used to accelerate the interconversion among different rotameric
	states of the side chains in the neighborhood of the binding site.
	Exchanges are allowed to occur alternatively along the axes corresponding
	to the thermodynamic coupling parameter λ and the boosting potential,
	in an extended dual array of coupled λ- and H-REMD simulations. The
	method is implemented on the basis of new extensions to the REPDSTR
	module of the biomolecular simulation program CHARMM. As an illustrative
	example, the absolute binding free energy of p-xylene to the nonpolar
	cavity of the L99A mutant of the T4 lysozyme was calculated. The
	tests demonstrate that the dual λ-REMD and H-REMD simulation scheme
	greatly accelerates the configurational sampling of the rotameric
	states of the side chains around the binding pocket, thereby improving
	the convergence of the FEP computations.},

  abstract = {During the 1980s, advances in the abilities to perform computer simulations
	of chemical and biomolecular systems and to calculate free energy
	changes led to the expectation that such methodology would soon show
	great utility for guiding molecular design. Important potential applications
	included design of selective receptors, catalysts, and regulators
	of biological function including enzyme inhibitors. This time also
	saw the rise of high-throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry
	along with complementary computational methods for de novo design
	and virtual screening including docking. These technologies appeared
	poised to deliver diverse lead compounds for any biological target.
	As with many technological advances, realization of the expectations
	required significant additional effort and time. However, as summarized
	here, striking success has now been achieved for computer-aided drug
	lead generation and optimization. De novo design using both molecular
	growing and docking are illustrated for lead generation, and lead
	optimization features free energy perturbation calculations in conjunction
	with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations for protein-inhibitor
	complexes in aqueous solution. The specific applications are to the
	discovery of non-nucleoside inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase
	(HIV-RT) and inhibitors of the binding of the proinflammatory cytokine
	MIF to its receptor CD74. A standard protocol is presented that includes
	scans for possible additions of small substituents to a molecular
	core, interchange of heterocycles, and focused optimization of substituents
	at one site. Initial leads with activities at low-micromolar concentrations
	have been advanced rapidly to low-nanomolar inhibitors.},

	substates. From the functional standpoint, there are two key points:
	first, all functionally relevant substates pre-exist; and second,
	the landscape is dynamic and the relative populations of the substates
	will change following allosteric events. Allosteric events perturb
	the structure, and the energetic strain propagates and shifts the
	population. This can lead to changes in the shapes and properties

	ensembles focusing on allosteric events in signaling. We propose

  abstract = {A unified framework integrating the generalized ensemble sampling
	associated with the Tsallis weight [C. Tsallis, J. Stat. Phys. 52,
	479 (1988)] and the replica exchange method (REM) has been proposed
	to accelerate the convergence of the conventional temperature REM
	(t-REM). Using the effective temperature formulation of the Tsallis
	weight sampling, it is shown that the average acceptance probability
	for configurational swaps between neighboring replicas in the combination
	of Tsallis weight sampling and REM (Tsallis-REM) is directly proportional
	to an overlap integral of the energy distributions of neighboring
	replicas as in the t-REM. Based on this observation, we suggest a
	robust method to select optimal Tsallis parameters in the conventional
	parametrization scheme and present new parametrization schemes for
	the Tsallis-REM, which significantly improves the acceptance of configurational
	swaps by systematically modulating energy overlaps between neighboring
	replicas. The distinguished feature of our method is that all relevant
	parameters in the Tsallis-REM are automatically determined from the
	equilibrium phase simulation using the t-REM. The overall performance
	of our method is explicitly demonstrated for various simulation conditions
	for the Lennard-Jones 31 atom clusters, exhibiting a double-funneled
	energy landscape.},

	estimates of many important biological phenomena including hydration
	energies, protein-ligand binding affinities and energetics of conformational

	integration methods, lambda-dynamics treats the conventional "lambda"
	as a dynamic variable in free energy simulations and simultaneously
	evaluates thermodynamic properties for multiple states in a single
	simulation. In the present article, we provide an overview of the
	theory of lambda-dynamics, including the use of biasing and restraining
	potentials to facilitate conformational sampling. We review how lambda-dynamics
	has been used to rapidly and reliably compute relative hydration
	free energies and binding affinities for series of ligands, to accurately
	identify crystallographically observed binding modes starting from
	incorrect orientations, and to model the effects of mutations upon
	protein stability. Finally, we suggest how lambda-dynamics may be
	extended to facilitate modeling efforts in structure-based drug design.},

	Here, we report favorable antigenic characteristics of vaccine candidates
	isolated from a combinatorial library of human rhinoviruses displaying
	the ELDKWA epitope of the gp41 glycoprotein of HIV-1. The design
	principles of this library emerged from the application of molecular
	modeling calculations in conjunction with our knowledge of previously
	obtained ELDKWA-displaying chimeras, including knowledge of a chimera
	with one of the best 2F5-binding characteristics obtained to date.
	The molecular modeling calculations identified the energetic and
	structural factors affecting the ability of the epitope to assume
	conformations capable of fitting into the complementarity determining
	region of the ELDKWA-binding, broadly neutralizing human mAb 2F5.
	Individual viruses were isolated from the library following competitive
	immunoselection and were tested using ELISA and fluorescence quenching
	experiments. Dissociation constants obtained using both techniques
	revealed that some of the newly isolated chimeras bind 2F5 with greater
	affinity than previously identified chimeric rhinoviruses. Molecular
	dynamics simulations of two of these same chimeras confirmed that
	their HIV inserts were partially preorganized for binding, which
	is largely responsible for their corresponding gains in binding affinity.
	The study illustrates the utility of combining structure-based experiments
	with computational modeling approaches for improving the odds of
	selecting vaccine component designs with preferred antigenic characteristics.
	The results obtained also confirm the flexibility of HRV as a presentation
	vehicle for HIV epitopes and the potential of this platform for the

	virus (HIV) vaccines is located in the membrane-proximal external
	region (MPER) of the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope spike structure.
	The crystal structure of the peptide corresponding to the so-called
	ELDKWA epitope (HIV-1 HxB2 gp41 residues 662-668), in complex with
	the corresponding broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibody
	2F5, provides a target for structure-based vaccine design strategies
	aimed at finding macromolecular carriers that are able to present
	this MPER-derived epitope with optimal antigenic activity. To this
	end, a series of replica exchange molecular dynamics computer simulations
	was conducted to characterize the distributions of conformations
	of ELDKWA-based epitopes inserted into a rhinovirus carrier and to
	identify those with the highest fraction of conformations that are
	able to bind 2F5. The length, hydrophobic character, and precise
	site of insertion were found to be critical for achieving structural
	similarity to the target crystal structure. A construct with a high
	degree of complementarity to the corresponding determinant region
	of 2F5 was obtained. This construct was employed to build a high-resolution
	structural model of the complex between the 2F5 antibody and the
	chimeric human rhinovirus type 14:HIV-1 ELDKWA virus particle. Additional
	simulations, which were conducted to study the conformational propensities
	of the ELDKWA region in solution, confirm the hypothesis that the
	ELDKWA region of gp41 is highly flexible and capable of assuming
	helical conformations (as in the postfusion helical bundle structure)
	and beta-turn conformations (as in the complex with the 2F5 antibody).
	These results also suggest that the ELDKWA epitope can be involved
	in intramolecular--and likely intermolecular--hydrophobic interactions.
	This tendency offers an explanation for the observation that mutations
	decreasing the hydrophobic character of the MPER in many cases result
	in conformational changes that increase the affinity of this region
	for the 2F5 antibody.},

  abstract = {Free-energy changes are essential physicochemical quantities for understanding
	most biochemical processes. Yet, the application of accurate thermodynamic-integration
	(TI) computation to biological and macromolecular systems is limited
	by finite-sampling artifacts. In this paper, we employ independent-trajectories
	thermodynamic-integration (IT-TI) computation to estimate improved
	free-energy changes and their uncertainties for (bio)molecular systems.
	IT-TI aids sampling statistics of the thermodynamic macrostates for
	flexible associating partners by ensemble averaging of multiple,
	independent simulation trajectories. We study peramivir (PVR) inhibition
	of the H5N1 avian influenza virus neuraminidase flexible receptor
	(N1). Binding site loops 150 and 119 are highly mobile, as revealed
	by N1-PVR 20-ns molecular dynamics. Due to such heterogeneous sampling,
	standard TI binding free-energy estimates span a rather large free-energy
	range, from a 19\% underestimation to a 29\% overestimation of the
	experimental reference value (-62.2 +/- 1.8 kJ mol(-1)). Remarkably,
	our IT-TI binding free-energy estimate (-61.1 +/- 5.4 kJ mol(-1))
	agrees with a 2\% relative difference. In addition, IT-TI runs provide
	a statistics-based free-energy uncertainty for the process of interest.
	Using approximately 800 ns of overall sampling, we investigate N1-PVR
	binding determinants by IT-TI alchemical modifications of PVR moieties.
	These results emphasize the dominant electrostatic contribution,
	particularly through the N1 E277-PVR guanidinium interaction. Future
	drug development may be also guided by properly tuning ligand flexibility
	and hydrophobicity. IT-TI will allow estimation of relative free
	energies for systems of increasing size, with improved reliability
	by employing large-scale distributed computing.},

	AST binds the 1BZA and 2BEA inhibitors 0.8 and 0.5 kcal/mole more
	strongly than BT. However, structural interactions and orientations
	of the inhibitors within the S1 site have been found to be virtually
	identical in the three enzymes studied. For example, the four water
	molecules in the inhibitor-free structures of AST and BT are channeled
	into similar positions in the S1 site, and the nitrogen atom(s) of
	the inhibitors are found in two cationic binding sites denoted Position1
	and Position2. The hydrophobic binding contributions for all five
	inhibitors, estimated by the LIE calculations, are also in the same
	order (-2.1 +/- 0.2 kcal/mole) for all three enzymes. Our hypothesis
	is therefore that the observed variation in inhibitor binding arises
	from different electrostatic interactions originating from residues
	outside the S1 site. This is well illustrated by AST, in which Asp
	150 and Glu 221B, despite some distance from the S1 binding site,
	lower the electrostatic potential of the S1 site and thus enhance
	substrate binding. Because the trends in the experimentally determined
	binding energies were reproduced by the LIE calculations after adding
	the contribution from long-range interactions, we find this method
	very suitable for rational studies of protein-substrate interactions.},

	The nonpolar component of the hydration free energy, consisting of
	a repulsive cavity term and an attractive van der Waals solute-solvent
	interaction term, is often modeled using estimators based on the
	solvent exposed solute surface area. In this paper, we analyze the
	accuracy of linear surface area models for predicting the van der
	Waals solute-solvent interaction energies of native and non-native
	protein conformations, peptides and small molecules, and the desolvation
	penalty of protein-protein and protein-ligand binding complexes.
	The target values are obtained from explicit solvent simulations
	and from a continuum solvent van der Waals interaction energy model.
	The results indicate that the standard surface area model, while
	useful on a coarse-grained scale, may not be accurate or transferable
	enough for high resolution modeling studies of protein folding and
	binding. The continuum model constructed in the course of this study
	provides one path for the development of a computationally efficient

	A (CsA, 1) shows a cluster of four water molecules buried at the
	binding interface, which is rearranged when CsA is replaced by (5-hydroxynorvaline)-2-cyclosporin
	(2). The thermodynamic contributions of each bound water molecule
	in the two complexes are explored with the inhomogeneous fluid solvation
	theory and molecular dynamics simulations. Water (WTR) 133 in complex
	1 contributes little to the binding affinity, while WTR6 and 7 in
	complex 2 play an essential role in mediating protein−ligand binding
	with a hydrogen bond network. The calculations reveal that the rearrangement
	of the water molecules contributes favorably to the binding affinity,
	even though one of them is displaced going from ligand 1 to 2. Another
	favorable contribution comes from the larger protein−ligand interactions
	of ligand 2. However, these favorable contributions are not sufficient
	to overcome the unfavorable desolvation free energy change and the
	conformational entropy of the hydroxylpropyl group of ligand 2 in
	the complex, leading to a lower binding affinity of ligand 2. These
	physical insights may be useful in the development of improved scoring

	by computer simulation is to obtain a reliable estimate within feasible

	by exploring a simple method, overlap sampling (OS), for producing
	reliable free-energy results in an efficient way. The formalism of
	the OS method is based on ensuring sampling of important overlapping
	phase space during perturbation calculations. This technique samples
	both forward and reverse free energy perturbation (FEP) to improve
	the free-energy calculation. It considers the asymmetry of the FEP
	calculation and features an ability to optimize both the precision
	and the accuracy of the measurement without affecting the simulation
	process itself. The OS method is tested at two optimization levels:
	no optimization (simple OS), and full optimization (equivalent to
	Bennett's method), and compared to conventional FEP techniques, including
	the widely used direct FEP averaging method, on three alchemical
	mutation systems: (a) an anion transformation in water solution,
	(b) mutation between methanol and ethane, and (c) alchemical change
	of an adenosine molecule. It is consistently shown that the reliability
	of free-energy estimates can be greatly improved using the OS techniques
	at both optimization levels, while the performance of Bennett's method
	is particularly striking. In addition, the efficiency of a calculation
	can be significantly improved because the method is able to (a) converge
	to the right answer quickly, and (b) work for large perturbations.
	The basic two-stage OS method can be extended to admit additional
	stages, if needed. We suggest that the OS method can be used as a
	general perturbation technique for computing free energy differences
	in molecular simulations.},

	van der Waals (vdw) surface area of ligands has the highest Pearson

	that one more ligand-bound water molecule is expected for every additional
	24 Å2 in the polar vdw surface area of the ligand. In contrast to

	have more than three polar interactions, they are significantly less

  abstract = {Three possible channels by which substrates and products can exit
	from the buried active site of cytochrome P450cam have been identified
	by means of random expulsion molecular dynamics simulations. In the
	investigation described here, we computed estimates of the relative
	probabilities of ligand passage through the three channels using
	steered molecular dynamics and adiabatic mapping. For comparison,
	the same techniques are also applied to investigate substrate egress
	from cytochrome P450-BM3. The channel in cytochrome P450cam, for
	which there is the most supporting evidence from experiments (which
	we name pathway 2a), is computed to be the most probable ligand exit
	channel. It has the smallest computed unbinding work and force. For
	this channel, the ligand exits between the F/G loop and the B' helix.
	Two mechanistically distinct, but energetically similar routes through
	this channel were observed, showing that multiple pathways along
	one channel are possible. The probability of ligand exit via the
	next most probable channel (pathway 3), which is located between
	the I helix and the F and G helices, is estimated to be less than
	1/10 of the probability of exit along pathway 2a. Low-frequency modes
	of the protein extracted from an essential dynamics analysis of a
	1 ns duration molecular dynamics simulation of cytochrome P450cam
	with camphor bound, support the opening of pathway 2a on a longer
	timescale. On longer timescales, it is therefore expected that this
	pathway becomes more dominant than estimated from the present computations.},

	AB is to equate chemical potentials of the species on the left- and

	from theory. This theory involves (usually hidden) assumptions about
	what constitutes the bound species, AB, and where the contribution
	of the solvent appears. We present here an alternative derivation
	that can be traced back to Bjerrum, in which the expectation value

	AB is obtained directly through the statistical mechanical method
	of evaluating its ensemble (Boltzmann-weighted) average. The generalized
	Bjerrum approach more clearly delineates: (i) the different contributions
	to binding; (ii) the origin of the much-discussed and somewhat controversial
	association entropy term; and (iii) where the solvent contribution
	appears. This approach also allows approximations required for practical
	evaluation of the binding constant in complex macromolecular systems,
	to be introduced in a well defined way. We provide an example, with

	ions in buffered water with values of K(a) ranging from approximately

	congener toward guests by competitive binding at the ureidyl C horizontal
	lineO portals. Although the acyclic cucurbit[n]uril congeners retain

	supplemented with ab initio results. The peptide backbone bonding

	energies and geometries of complexes between water and model compounds

	dipole moments, experimental heats and free energies of vaporization,
	solvation and sublimation, molecular volumes, and crystal pressures

	A detailed analysis of the relationship between the alanine dipeptide

	a consistent set for condensed-phase simulations of a wide variety

	analysis of internal and overall motion yields simulated order parameters
	substantially closer to the experimentally determined values than
	is the case for a conventional analysis of internal motion alone.
	Improved agreement between simulation and experiment also is encouraging

  abstract = {It is widely accepted that the binding constant of a receptor and
	ligand can be written as a two-body integral involving the interaction
	energy of the receptor and the ligand. Interestingly, however, three
	different theories of binding in the literature dictate three distinct
	integrals. The present study uses theory, as well as simulations
	of binding experiments, to test the validity of the three integrals.
	When binding is measured by a signal that detects the ligand in the
	binding site, the most accurate results are obtained by an integral
	of the Boltzmann factor, where the bound complex is defined in terms
	of an exclusive binding region. A novel prediction of this approach,
	that expanding a ligand can increase its binding constant, is borne
	out by the simulations. The simulations also show that abnormal binding
	isotherms can be obtained when the region over which the signal is
	detected deviates markedly from the exclusion zone. Interestingly,
	the binding constant measured by equilibrium dialysis, rather than
	by monitoring a localized signal, can yield a binding constant that
	differs from that obtained from a signal measurement, and that is
	matched best by the integral of the Mayer factor.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a free energy calculation method based on the
	molecular dynamics simulation combined with the three dimensional
	reference interaction site model theory. This study employs the free
	energy perturbation (FEP) and the thermodynamic integration (TDI)
	along the coupling parameters to control the interaction potential.
	To illustrate the method, we applied it to a complex formation process
	in aqueous solutions between a crown ether molecule 18-Crown-6 (18C6)
	and a potassium ion as one of the simplest model systems. Two coupling
	parameters were introduced to switch the Lennard-Jones potential
	and the Coulomb potential separately. We tested two coupling procedures:
	one is a "sequential-coupling" to couple the Lennard-Jones interaction
	followed by the Coulomb coupling, and the other is a "mixed-coupling"
	to couple both the Lennard-Jones and the Coulomb interactions together
	as much as possible. The sequential-coupling both for FEP and TDI
	turned out to be accurate and easily handled since it was numerically
	well-behaved. Furthermore, it was found that the sequential-coupling
	had relatively small statistical errors. TDI along the mixed-coupling
	integral path was to be carried out carefully, paying attention to
	a numerical behavior of the integrand. The present model system exhibited
	a nonmonotonic behavior in the integrands for TDI along the mixed-coupling
	integral path and also showed a relatively large statistical error.
	A coincidence within a statistical error was obtained among the results
	of the free energy differences evaluated by FEP, TDI with the sequential-coupling,
	and TDI with the mixed-coupling. The last one is most attractive
	in terms of the computer power and is accurate enough if one uses
	a proper set of windows, taking the numerical behavior of the integrands
	into account. TDI along the sequential-coupling integral path would
	be the most convenient among the methods we tested, since it seemed
	to be well-balanced between the computational load and the accuracy.
	The numerical results reported in this article qualitatively agree
	with the experimental data for the potassium ion recognition by the
	18C6 in aqueous solution.},

	have started tackling these problems with the use of experimental
	and simulation methods and developed models describing the variation
	of protein dynamics upon complex formation, shedding light on how
	substrate or inhibitor binding can alter protein flexibility and
	function. The study of ligand-induced dynamic variations has also
	been exploited to review the concept of allosteric changes, in the
	absence of major conformational changes. In this context, the study
	of the influence of protein motions on signal transduction and on
	catalytic activities has been used to develop pharmacophore models
	based on ensembles of protein conformations. These models, taking
	flexibility explicitly into account, are able to distinguish active
	inhibitors versus nonactive drug-like compounds, to define new molecular
	motifs and to preferentially identify specific ligands for a certain
	protein target. The application of these methods holds great promise
	in advancing structure-based drug discovery and medicinal chemistry
	in general, opening up the possibility to explore broader chemical
	spaces than is normally done in an efficient way. In this review,
	examples illustrating the extent to which simulations can be used
	to understand these phenomena will be presented along with examples
	of methodological developments to increase physical understanding
	of the processes and improve the possibility to rationally design
	new molecules.},

	moves to various extents in response to binding the different ligands.
	The part of the binding site that remains rigid is characterized

	The more flexible region, characterized by relatively high temperature

	of binding free energies (J. Comput. Chem. 2003, 24, 954). Hence,
	we sought to calibrate directly the solvation terms in the context

	a set of 99 protein-ligand complexes. We obtained a mean unsigned

	lowest errors were obtained with solute dielectric values of Din
	= 20 or higher and scaling of the intermolecular van der Waals interaction
	energy by factors ranging from 0.03 to 0.15. The high apparent Din

	(relative to the liquid) is countered by the freezing of side chain
	motion. The identical effect should occur in association reactions,

	their relative probability, is one of the major challenges in protein
	folding theory today. Although this information is in principle accessible
	via all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, it is difficult to compute
	in practice because protein folding is a rare event and the affordable
	simulation length is typically not sufficient to observe an appreciable
	number of folding events, unless very simplified protein models are
	used. Here we present an approach that allows for the reconstruction
	of the full ensemble of folding pathways from simulations that are
	much shorter than the folding time. This approach can be applied
	to all-atom protein simulations in explicit solvent. It does not
	use a predefined reaction coordinate but is based on partitioning
	the state space into small conformational states and constructing
	a Markov model between them. A theory is presented that allows for
	the extraction of the full ensemble of transition pathways from the
	unfolded to the folded configurations. The approach is applied to
	the folding of a PinWW domain in explicit solvent where the folding
	time is two orders of magnitude larger than the length of individual
	simulations. The results are in good agreement with kinetic experimental
	data and give detailed insights about the nature of the folding process
	which is shown to be surprisingly complex and parallel. The analysis
	reveals the existence of misfolded trap states outside the network
	of efficient folding intermediates that significantly reduce the

  abstract = {We simulate the folding/unfolding equilibrium of the 20-residue miniprotein
	Trp-cage. We use replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations
	of the AMBER94 atomic detail model of the protein explicitly solvated
	by water, starting from a completely unfolded configuration. We employ
	a total of 40 replicas, covering the temperature range between 280
	and 538 K. Individual simulation lengths of 100 ns sum up to a total
	simulation time of about 4 micros. Without any bias, we observe the
	folding of the protein into the native state with an unfolding-transition
	temperature of about 440 K. The native state is characterized by
	a distribution of root mean square distances (RMSD) from the NMR
	data that peaks at 1.8A, and is as low as 0.4A. We show that equilibration
	times of about 40 ns are required to yield convergence. A folded
	configuration in the entire extended ensemble is found to have a
	lifetime of about 31 ns. In a clamp-like motion, the Trp-cage opens
	up during thermal denaturation. In line with fluorescence quenching
	experiments, the Trp-residue sidechain gets hydrated when the protein
	opens up, roughly doubling the number of water molecules in the first
	solvation shell. We find the helical propensity of the helical domain
	of Trp-cage rather well preserved even at very high temperatures.
	In the folded state, we can identify states with one and two buried
	internal water molecules interconnecting parts of the Trp-cage molecule
	by hydrogen bonds. The loss of hydrogen bonds of these buried water
	molecules in the folded state with increasing temperature is likely
	to destabilize the folded state at elevated temperatures.},

	of the conformational changes drug-like molecules experience upon
	binding. Ligand strain energies and conformational reorganization
	were analyzed with different computational methods on 150 crystal
	structures of pharmaceutically relevant protein-ligand complexes.
	The common knowledge that ligands rarely bind in their lowest calculated
	energy conformation was confirmed. Additionally, we found that over
	60\% of the ligands do not bind in a local minimum conformation.
	While approximately 60\% of the ligands were calculated to bind with
	strain energies lower than 5 kcal/mol, strain energies over 9 kcal/mol
	were calculated in at least 10\% of the cases regardless of the method
	used. A clear correlation was found between acceptable strain energy
	and ligand flexibility, while there was no correlation between strain
	energy and binding affinity, thus indicating that expensive conformational
	rearrangements can be tolerated in some cases without overly penalizing
	the tightness of binding. On the basis of the trends observed, thresholds
	for the acceptable strain energies of bioactive conformations were
	defined with consideration of the impact of ligand flexibility. An
	analysis of the degree of folding of the bound ligands confirmed
	the general tendency of small molecules to bind in an extended conformation.
	The results suggest that the unfolding of hydrophobic ligands during
	binding, which exposes hydrophobic surfaces to contact with protein
	residues, could be one of the factors accounting for high reorganization
	energies. Finally, different methods for conformational analysis
	were evaluated, and guidelines were defined to maximize the prevalence
	of bioactive conformations in computationally generated ensembles.},

	polymers, such as proteins, includes information about their structure
	and their dynamics. In particular it is of utmost importance to answer
	the following questions: What are the structural conformations possible?
	Is there any relevant hierarchy among these conformers? What are
	the transition paths between them? These and other questions can
	be addressed by analyzing in an efficient way the Free Energy Landscape
	of the system. With this knowledge, several problems about biomolecular
	reactions (such as enzymatic activity, protein folding, protein deposition
	diseases, etc.) can be tackled. In this article we show how to efficiently
	describe the Free Energy Landscape for small and large peptides.
	By mapping the trajectories of molecular dynamics simulations into
	a graph (the Conformational Markov Network) and unveiling its structural
	organization, we obtain a coarse grained description of the protein
	dynamics across the Free Energy Landscape in terms of the relevant
	kinetic magnitudes of the system. Therefore, we show the way to bridge
	the gap between the microscopic dynamics and the macroscopic kinetics
	by means of a mesoscopic description of the associated Conformational
	Markov Network. Along this path the compromise between the physical
	nature of the process and the magnitudes that characterize the network

  abstract = {The SAMPL2 hydration free energy blind prediction challenge consisted
	of a data set of 41 molecules divided into three subsets: explanatory,
	obscure and investigatory, where experimental hydration free energies
	were given for the explanatory, withheld for the obscure, and not
	known for the investigatory molecules. We employed two solvation
	models for this challenge, a linear interaction energy (LIE) model
	based on explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations, and the first-shell
	hydration (FiSH) continuum model previously calibrated to mimic LIE
	data. On the 23 compounds from the obscure (blind) dataset, the prospectively
	submitted LIE and FiSH models provided predictions highly correlated
	with experimental hydration free energy data, with mean-unsigned-errors
	of 1.69 and 1.71 kcal/mol, respectively. We investigated several
	parameters that may affect the performance of these models, namely,
	the solute flexibility for the LIE explicit-solvent model, the solute
	partial charging method, and the incorporation of the difference
	in intramolecular energy between gas and solution phases for both
	models. We extended this analysis to the various chemical classes
	that can be formed within the SAMPL2 dataset. Our results strengthen
	previous findings on the excellent accuracy and transferability of
	the LIE explicit-solvent approach to predict transfer free energies
	across a wide spectrum of functional classes. Further, the current
	results on the SAMPL2 test dataset provide additional support for
	the FiSH continuum model as a fast yet accurate alternative to the
	LIE explicit-solvent model. Overall, both the LIE explicit-solvent
	model and the FiSH continuum solvation model show considerable improvement
	on the SAMPL2 data set over our previous continuum electrostatics-dispersion
	solvation model used in the SAMPL1 blind challenge.},

	On the other hand, explicit solvent simulations show significant

	It has not been obvious how implicit solvation models can be modified
	in a general way to address this serious shortcoming. We solve this
	problem by using the induced surface charge density (ISCD) obtained
	from a boundary element solution of the Poisson equation to derive
	a simple customized correction for the Born radius of each atom.
	This simple correction restores the charge asymmetry and reproduces
	the hydration free energies from free energy perturbation calculations
	with a high degree of fidelity. The induced surface charge density
	profile of an atom essentially provides a measure of the average
	preferred orientation of a water molecule in the first solvation
	shell, thereby allowing a proper assignment of the dielectric boundary.
	We refer to these modified radii as ISCD-corrected Born radii.},

  abstract = {The ribose-binding protein (RBP) is a sugar-binding bacterial periplasmic
	protein whose function is associated with a large allosteric conformational
	change from an open to a closed conformation upon binding to ribose.
	The crystal structures of RBP in open and closed conformations have
	been solved. It has been hypothesized that the open and closed conformations
	exist in a dynamic equilibrium in solution, and that sugar binding
	shifts the population from open conformations to closed conformations.
	Here, we study by computer simulations the thermodynamic changes
	that accompany this conformational change, and model the structural
	changes that accompany the allosteric transition, using umbrella
	sampling molecular dynamics and the weighted histogram analysis method.
	The open state is comprised of a diverse ensemble of conformations;
	the open ribose-free X-ray crystal conformations being representative
	of this ensemble. The unligated open form of RBP is stabilized by
	conformational entropy. The simulations predict detectable populations
	of closed ribose-free conformations in solution. Additional interdomain
	hydrogen bonds stabilize this state. The predicted shift in equilibrium
	from the open to the closed state on binding to ribose is in agreement
	with experiments. This is driven by the energetic stabilization of
	the closed conformation due to ribose-protein interactions. We also
	observe a significant population of a hitherto unobserved ribose-bound
	partially open state. We believe that this state is the one that
	has been suggested to play a role in the transfer of ribose to the
	membrane-bound permease complex.},

  abstract = {Computing converged ensemble properties remains challenging for large
	biomolecules. Replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) can significantly
	increase the efficiency of conformational sampling by using high
	temperatures to escape kinetic traps. Several groups, including ours,
	introduced the idea of coupling replica exchange to a pre-converged,
	Boltzmann-populated reservoir, usually at a temperature higher than
	that of the highest temperature replica. This procedure reduces computational
	cost because the long simulation times needed for extensive sampling
	are only carried out for a single temperature. However, a weakness
	of the approach is that the Boltzmann-weighted reservoir can still
	be difficult to generate. We now present the idea of employing a
	non-Boltzmann reservoir, whose structures can be generated through
	more efficient conformational sampling methods. We demonstrate that
	the approach is rigorous and derive a correct statistical mechanical
	exchange criterion between the reservoir and the replicas that drives
	Boltzmann-weighted probabilities for the replicas. We test this approach
	on the trpzip2 peptide and demonstrate that the resulting thermal
	stability profile is essentially indistinguishable from that obtained
	using very long (>100 ns) standard REMD simulations. The convergence
	of this reservoir-aided REMD is significantly faster than for regular
	REMD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that modification of the exchange
	criterion is essential; REMD simulations using a standard exchange
	function with the non-Boltzmann reservoir produced incorrect results.},

	field has been successfully used in biomolecular simulations, for

	but no applications to lipid systems have been published yet. Here
	we provide a detailed investigation of aliphatic liquid systems.
	For liquids of larger aliphatic chains, n-heptane and longer, the
	standard GROMOS96 parameter sets 43A1 and 43A2 yield a too low pressure
	at the experimental density. Therefore, a reparametrization of the
	GROMOS96 force field regarding aliphatic carbons was initiated. The
	new force field parameter set 45A3 shows considerable improvements
	for n-alkanes, cyclo-, iso-, and neoalkanes and other branched aliphatics.
	Liquid densities and heat of vaporization are reproduced for almost
	all of these molecules. Excellent agreement is found with experiment
	for the free energy of hydration for alkanes. The GROMOS96 45A3 parameter
	set should, therefore, be suitable for application to lipid aggregates
	such as membranes and micelles, for mixed systems of aliphatics with
	or without water, for polymers, and other apolar systems that may

	by Simian Virus 40 (SV40) is a marvelous molecule that is not only
	a viral oncogene, but also an efficient molecular machine as a helicase
	that unwinds double helix DNA for genome replication, an essential
	process in all living organisms. LTag hexameric helicase uses the
	energy of ATP to power its conformational switch for DNA unwinding.
	Understanding how the LTag conformational switch is coupled to the
	energy from ATP usage by LTag to do the mechanical work of unwinding
	DNA is of great interest to biologists, and yet remains to be established.
	Based on our previous high-resolution structures of LTag helicase
	in different conformational states, we simulated an LTag conformational
	transition pathway in the ATP binding process using the targeted
	molecular dynamics method. Our simulation results suggest a three-step
	process for the ATP binding to the nucleotide pocket, in which ATP
	is eventually “locked” into the pocket by three pairs of “locker”
	interactions. We have also quantitatively evaluated the energy profile
	of ATP binding using a special computational simulation technique.
	Additionally, our simulation study of ATP binding by LTag and the
	accompanying conformational switches in the context of a hexamer
	leads to a refined cooperative iris model that may be used for DNA
	unwinding.</p>},

  abstract = {We present a new estimator for computing free energy differences and
	thermodynamic expectations as well as their uncertainties from samples
	obtained from multiple equilibrium states via either simulation or
	experiment. The estimator, which we call the multistate Bennett acceptance
	ratio estimator (MBAR) because it reduces to the Bennett acceptance
	ratio estimator (BAR) when only two states are considered, has significant
	advantages over multiple histogram reweighting methods for combining
	data from multiple states. It does not require the sampled energy
	range to be discretized to produce histograms, eliminating bias due
	to energy binning and significantly reducing the time complexity
	of computing a solution to the estimating equations in many cases.
	Additionally, an estimate of the statistical uncertainty is provided
	for all estimated quantities. In the large sample limit, MBAR is
	unbiased and has the lowest variance of any known estimator for making
	use of equilibrium data collected from multiple states. We illustrate
	this method by producing a highly precise estimate of the potential
	of mean force for a DNA hairpin system, combining data from multiple
	optical tweezer measurements under constant force bias.},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated the Bennett acceptance ratio method is
	the best asymptotically unbiased method for determining the equilibrium
	free energy between two end states given work distributions collected
	from either equilibrium and nonequilibrium data. However, it is still
	not clear what the practical advantage of this acceptance ratio method
	is over other common methods in atomistic simulations. In this study,
	we first review theoretical estimates of the bias and variance of
	exponential averaging (EXP), thermodynamic integration (TI), and
	the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR). In the process, we present a
	new simple scheme for computing the variance and bias of many estimators,
	and demonstrate the connections between BAR and the weighted histogram
	analysis method. Next, a series of analytically solvable toy problems
	is examined to shed more light on the relative performance in terms
	of the bias and efficiency of these three methods. Interestingly,
	it is impossible to conclusively identify a "best" method for calculating
	the free energy, as each of the three methods performs more efficiently
	than the others in at least one situation examined in these toy problems.
	Finally, sample problems of the insertion/deletion of both a Lennard-Jones
	particle and a much larger molecule in TIP3P water are examined by
	these three methods. In all tests of atomistic systems, free energies
	obtained with BAR have significantly lower bias and smaller variance
	than when using EXP or TI, especially when the overlap in phase space
	between end states is small. For example, BAR can extract as much
	information from multiple fast, far-from-equilibrium simulations
	as from fewer simulations near equilibrium, which EXP cannot. Although
	TI and sometimes even EXP can be somewhat more efficient in idealized
	toy problems, in the realistic atomistic situations tested in this
	paper, BAR is significantly more efficient than all other methods.},

  abstract = {The evaluation of the solvation entropies is a major conceptual and
	practical challenge. On the one hand, it is interesting to quantify
	the factors that are responsible for the solvation entropies in solutions,
	whereas on the other, it is essential to be able to assess the contributions
	of the solvation entropies to the binding free energies and related
	properties. In fact, the solvation entropies are neglected in almost
	all of the studies of the binding entropies. The main problem is
	that widely used approaches, such as the quasiharmonic (QH) approximation,
	do not provide reliable results particularly in cases of shallow
	potential and multidimensional surfaces while brute force evaluations
	of the entropic effects by simulating temperature dependence of the
	free energy converges very slowly. This paper addresses the above
	issue by starting with an analysis of the factors that are responsible
	for the negative solvation entropy of ions, showing that it is not
	due to the change in the solvent vibration modes or to the solvent
	force constant but to the changes in the solvent configurational
	space upon change in the solute charges. We begin by clarifying that
	when one deals with aqueous solutions, it is easy to evaluate the
	corresponding entropic effect by the Langevin dipole (LD) treatment.
	However, in this work we are interested in developing a general microscopic
	tool that can be used to study similar effects in the proteins. To
	this end, we explore the ability of our restraint release (RR) approach
	to evaluate the solvation entropy. We start this analysis by reviewing
	the foundation of this approach and in particular, the requirements
	of minimizing the enthalpy contribution to the RR free energy. We
	then establish that our approach is not a specialized harmonic treatment
	but a rather powerful general approach. Moving to the main topic
	of this work, we demonstrate that the RR approach provides quantitative
	results for the solvation entropies of monovalent and divalent ions
	and effectively captures the physics of these entropic effects. The
	success of the current approach indicates that it should be applicable
	to the studies of the solvation entropies in the proteins and also,
	in examining hydrophobic effects. Thus, we believe that the RR approach
	provides a powerful tool for evaluating the corresponding contributions
	to the binding entropies and, eventually, to the binding free energies.
	This holds promise for extending the information theory modeling
	to proteins and protein-ligand complexes in aqueous solutions and
	consequently, facilitating computer-aided drug design.},

	is of paramount importance in drug discovery efforts. Protein-ligand
	docking aims to predict and rank the structure(s) arising from the
	association between a given ligand and a target protein of known
	3D structure. Despite the breathtaking advances in the field over
	the last decades and the widespread application of docking methods,
	several downsides still exist. In particular, protein flexibility-a
	critical aspect for a thorough understanding of the principles that
	guide ligand binding in proteins-is a major hurdle in current protein-ligand
	docking efforts that needs to be more efficiently accounted for.
	In this review the key concepts of protein-ligand docking methods
	are outlined, with major emphasis being given to the general strengths
	and weaknesses that presently characterize this methodology. Despite
	the size of the field, the principal types of search algorithms and
	scoring functions are reviewed and the most popular docking tools
	are briefly depicted. Recent advances that aim to address some of
	the traditional limitations associated with molecular docking are

	Structures were taken as snapshots from multi-nanosecond molecular

	Particle-Mesh Ewald procedure. The electrostatic contribution to
	solvation energies were computed using both a finite-difference Poisson-Boltzmann
	(PB) model and a pairwise Generalized Born model; non-electrostatic
	contributions were estimated with a surface-area dependent term.
	To these solvation free energies were added the mean solute internal
	energies (determined from a molecular mechanics potential) and estimates
	of the solute entropy (from a harmonic analysis). Consistent with
	experiment and with earlier solvated molecular dynamics simulations,
	the UUCG hairpin was found to prefer conformers close to a recent
	NMR structure determination in preference to those from an earlier
	NMR study. Similarly, results for the UGAA hairpin favored an NMR-derived
	structure over that to be expected for a generic GNRA hairpin loop.
	Experimental free energies are not known for the hairpin/duplex conversion,
	but must be close to zero since hairpins are seen in solution and
	duplexes in crystals; out calculations find a value near zero and

	The charge optimization methodology is applied in a probe-based approach

	according to charge selectivity, i.e., the binding cost of deviating

	in well-shaped concave pockets, whereas solvent-exposed convex regions
	are not charge selective. This suggests the synergy of charge and
	shape selectivity hot spots toward molecular selection and recognition,
	as well as the asymmetry of charge selectivity at the binding interface
	of biomolecular systems. The charge complementarity and selectivity
	profiles map relevant electrostatic properties in a readily interpretable

	employed a continuum model including a boundary element solution
	of the Poisson equation to describe electrostatic solvation, a molecular
	surface area-based cost of cavity formation in water, and a continuum
	Lennard-Jones potential to account for dispersion-repulsion solute-solvent

	coefficients were calibrated and validated on previously available

	model yielded SAMPL-1 predictions highly correlated with experimental
	data, albeit with a slope of slightly above 0.5, suggesting a valid
	model but with a systematic error. Analysis of the major outliers,
	all overestimating the experimental hydration data, highlights a
	common structural theme as a possible cause of the prediction errors:
	densely polar and hydrogen-bond-capable structures, featuring primarily
	substituted (sulfon)amide groups, often in conjugated systems. By
	examining analog pairs within the SAMPL-1 data set, it was also noted
	that certain solvation trends are captured neither by chemical sense
	nor by our hydration model, which seem too additive. A retrospective
	analysis of model transferability between hydration data sets as
	a function of its parameters and complexity indicates that the electrostatic
	component of the model is fairly transferrable across data sets,
	but the nonelectrostatic terms are less so. For the chemical space
	covered in SAMPL-1, absolute prediction errors indicate that the
	simpler transferrable electrostatics-only model outperforms the more
	complex model including cavity and continuum dispersion terms. Possible
	directions to further improve this continuum hydration model are

	In contrast to the Lee and Richards molecular surface, atom-centered
	surfaces result in interatomic crevices and buried pockets of high

	We show that these interstitial high dielectric regions are of significant
	magnitude in globular proteins, that they artificially increase solvation

	functions must exclude interstitial high dielectric regions in order

  abstract = { The use of estimating equations has been a common approach for constructing
	Monte Carlo estimators. Recently, Kong et al. proposed a formulation
	of Monte Carlo integration as a statistical model, making explicit
	what information is ignored and what is retained about the baseline
	measure. From simulated data, the baseline measure is estimated by
	maximum likelihood, and then integrals of interest are estimated
	by substituting the estimated measure. For two different situations
	in which independent observations are simulated from multiple distributions,
	we show that this likelihood approach achieves the lowest asymptotic
	variance possible by using estimating equations. In the first situation,
	the normalizing constants of the design distributions are estimated,
	and Meng and Wong's bridge sampling estimating equation is considered.
	In the second situation, the values of the normalizing constants
	are known, thereby imposing linear constraints on the baseline measure.
	Estimating equations including Hesterberg's stratified importance
	sampling estimator, Veach and Guibas's multiple importance sampling
	estimator, and Owen and Zhou's method of control variates are considered.

  abstract = {Transcription factors are central components of the intracellular
	regulatory networks that control gene expression. An increasingly
	recognized phenomenon among human transcription factors is the formation
	of structure upon target binding. Here, we study the folding and
	binding of the pKID domain of CREB to the KIX domain of the co-activator
	CBP. Our simulations of a topology-based Gō-type model predict a
	coupled folding and binding mechanism, and the existence of partially
	bound intermediates. From transition-path and Phi-value analyses,
	we find that the binding transition state resembles the unstructured
	state in solution, implying that CREB becomes structured only after
	committing to binding. A change of structure following binding is
	reminiscent of an induced-fit mechanism and contrasts with models
	in which binding occurs to pre-structured conformations that exist
	in the unbound state at equilibrium. Interestingly, increasing the
	amount of structure in the unbound pKID reduces the rate of binding,
	suggesting a "fly-casting"-like process. We find that the inclusion
	of attractive non-native interactions results in the formation of
	non-specific encounter complexes that enhance the on-rate of binding,
	but do not significantly change the binding mechanism. Our study
	helps explain how being unstructured can confer an advantage in protein
	target recognition. The simulations are in general agreement with
	the results of a recently reported nuclear magnetic resonance study,
	and aid in the interpretation of the experimental binding kinetics.},

  abstract = {Milestoning is a procedure to compute the time evolution of complicated
	processes such as barrier crossing events or long diffusive transitions
	between predefined states. Milestoning reduces the dynamics to transition
	events between intermediates (the milestones) and computes the local
	kinetic information to describe these transitions via short molecular
	dynamics (MD) runs between the milestones. The procedure relies on
	the ability to reinitialize MD trajectories on the milestones to
	get the right kinetic information about the transitions. It also
	rests on the assumptions that the transition events between successive
	milestones and the time lags between these transitions are statistically
	independent. In this paper, we analyze the validity of these assumptions.
	We show that sets of optimal milestones exist, i.e., sets such that
	successive transitions are indeed statistically independent. The
	proof of this claim relies on the results of transition path theory
	and uses the isocommittor surfaces of the reaction as milestones.
	For systems in the overdamped limit, we also obtain the probability
	distribution to reinitialize the MD trajectories on the milestones,
	and we discuss why this distribution is not available in closed form
	for systems with inertia. We explain why the time lags between transitions
	are not statistically independent even for optimal milestones, but
	we show that working with such milestones allows one to compute mean
	first passage times between milestones exactly. Finally, we discuss
	some practical implications of our results and we compare milestoning
	with Markov state models in view of our findings.},

	molecular dynamics simulations have had folding times in the range
	of nanoseconds to microseconds. We report simulations of several
	folding trajectories of NTL9(1-39), a protein which has a folding
	time of approximately 1.5 ms. Distributed molecular dynamics simulations
	in implicit solvent on GPU processors were used to generate ensembles
	of trajectories out to approximately 40 micros for several temperatures
	and starting states. At a temperature less than the melting point
	of the force field, we observe a small number of productive folding
	events, consistent with predictions from a model of parallel uncoupled
	two-state simulations. The posterior distribution of the folding
	rate predicted from the data agrees well with the experimental folding
	rate (approximately 640/s). Markov State Models (MSMs) built from
	the data show a gap in the implied time scales indicative of two-state
	folding and heterogeneous pathways connecting diffuse mesoscopic
	substates. Structural analysis of the 14 out of 2000 macrostates
	transited by the top 10 folding pathways reveals that native-like
	pairing between strands 1 and 2 only occurs for macrostates with
	p(fold) > 0.5, suggesting beta(12) hairpin formation may be rate-limiting.
	We believe that using simulation data such as these to seed adaptive
	resampling simulations will be a promising new method for achieving
	statistically converged descriptions of folding landscapes at longer

  abstract = {In cytochrome P450s, the active site is situated deep inside the protein
	next to the heme cofactor, and is often completely isolated from
	the surrounding solvent. To identify routes by which substrates may
	enter into and products exit from the active site, random expulsion
	molecular dynamics simulations were performed for three cytochrome
	P450s: CYP101, CYP102A1 and CYP107A1 [J. Mol. Biol. 303 (2000) 797;
	Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99 (2002) 5361]. Amongst the different
	pathways identified, one pathway was found to be common to all three
	cytochrome P450s although the mechanism of ligand passage along it
	was different in each case and apparently adapted to the substrate
	specificity of the enzyme. Recently, a number of new crystal structures
	of cytochrome P450s have been solved. Here, we analyse the open channels
	leading to the active site that these structures reveal. We find
	that in addition to showing the common pathway, they provide experimental
	evidence for the existence of three additional channels that were
	identified by simulation. We also discuss how the location of xenon
	binding sites in CYP101 suggests a role for one of the pathways identified
	by molecular dynamics simulations as a route for gaseous species,
	such as oxygen, to access the active site.},

  abstract = {The absolute (standard) binding free energy of eight FK506-related
	ligands to FKBP12 is calculated using free energy perturbation molecular
	dynamics (FEP/MD) simulations with explicit solvent. A number of
	features are implemented to improve the accuracy and enhance the
	convergence of the calculations. First, the absolute binding free
	energy is decomposed into sequential steps during which the ligand-surrounding
	interactions as well as various biasing potentials restraining the
	translation, orientation, and conformation of the ligand are turned
	"on" and "off." Second, sampling of the ligand conformation is enforced
	by a restraining potential based on the root mean-square deviation
	relative to the bound state conformation. The effect of all the restraining
	potentials is rigorously unbiased, and it is shown explicitly that
	the final results are independent of all artificial restraints. Third,
	the repulsive and dispersive free energy contribution arising from
	the Lennard-Jones interactions of the ligand with its surrounding
	(protein and solvent) is calculated using the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen
	separation. This separation also improves convergence of the FEP/MD
	calculations. Fourth, to decrease the computational cost, only a
	small number of atoms in the vicinity of the binding site are simulated
	explicitly, while all the influence of the remaining atoms is incorporated
	implicitly using the generalized solvent boundary potential (GSBP)
	method. With GSBP, the size of the simulated FKBP12/ligand systems
	is significantly reduced, from approximately 25,000 to 2500. The
	computations are very efficient and the statistical error is small
	( approximately 1 kcal/mol). The calculated binding free energies
	are generally in good agreement with available experimental data
	and previous calculations (within approximately 2 kcal/mol). The
	present results indicate that a strategy based on FEP/MD simulations
	of a reduced GSBP atomic model sampled with conformational, translational,
	and orientational restraining potentials can be computationally inexpensive
	and accurate.},

	IA3 is the endogenous inhibitor for the enzyme named yeast aspartic
	proteinase saccharopepsin (YPrA). In the presence of YPrA, IA3 folds
	itself into an amphipathic helix that blocks the active site cleft
	of the enzyme. We developed a multi-scaled approach to explore the
	underlying mechanism of this binding-induced ordering transition.
	Our approach combines a structure-based molecular dynamics model
	at the residue level with a stochastic path method at the atomic
	level. Our simulations suggest that IA3 inhibits YPrA through an
	induced-fit mechanism where the enzyme (YPrA) induces conformational
	change of its inhibitor (IA3). This expands the definition of an
	induced-fit model from its original meaning that the binding of substrate
	(IA3) drives conformational change in the protein (YPrA). Our result
	is consistent with recent kinetic experiments and provides a microscopic
	explanation for the underlying mechanism. We also discuss the important
	roles of non-native interactions and backtracking. These results
	enrich our understanding of the enzyme-inhibition mechanism and may
	have value in the design of drugs.</p>},

  abstract = {Biological processes often depend on protein-ligand binding events,
	yet accurate calculation of the associated energetics remains as
	a significant challenge of central importance to structure-based
	drug design. Recently, we have proposed that the displacement of
	unfavorable waters by the ligand, replacing them with groups complementary
	to the protein surface, is the principal driving force for protein-ligand
	binding, and we have introduced the WaterMap method to account this
	effect. However, in spite of the adage "nature abhors vacuum," one
	can occasionally observe situations in which a portion of the receptor
	active site is so unfavorable for water molecules that a void is
	formed there. In this paper, we demonstrate that the presence of
	dry regions in the receptor has a nontrivial effect on ligand binding
	affinity, and suggest that such regions may represent a general motif
	for molecular recognition between the dry region in the receptor
	and the hydrophobic groups in the ligands. With the introduction
	of a term attributable to the occupation of the dry regions by ligand
	atoms, combined with the WaterMap calculation, we obtain excellent
	agreement with experiment for the prediction of relative binding
	affinities for a number of congeneric ligand series binding to the
	major urinary protein receptor. In addition, WaterMap when combined
	with the cavity contribution is more predictive than at least one
	specific implementation [Abel R, Young T, Farid R, Berne BJ, Friesner

  abstract = {The binding affinities between a united-atom methane and various model
	hydrophobic enclosures were studied through high accuracy free energy
	perturbation methods (FEP). We investigated the non-additivity of
	the hydrophobic interaction in these systems, measured by the deviation
	of its binding affinity from that predicted by the pairwise additivity
	approximation. While only small non-additivity effects were previously
	reported in the interactions in methane trimers, we found large cooperative
	effects (as large as -1.14 kcal mol(-1) or approximately a 25\% increase
	in the binding affinity) and anti-cooperative effects (as large as
	0.45 kcal mol(-1)) for these model enclosed systems. Decomposition
	of the total potential of mean force (PMF) into increasing orders
	of multi-body interactions indicates that the contributions of the
	higher order multi-body interactions can be either positive or negative
	in different systems, and increasing the order of multi-body interactions
	considered did not necessarily improve the accuracy. A general correlation
	between the sign of the non-additivity effect and the curvature of
	the solute molecular surface was observed. We found that implicit
	solvent models based on the molecular surface area (MSA) performed
	much better, not only in predicting binding affinities, but also
	in predicting the non-additivity effects, compared with models based
	on the solvent accessible surface area (SASA), suggesting that MSA
	is a better descriptor of the curvature of the solutes. We also show
	how the non-additivity contribution changes as the hydrophobicity
	of the plate is decreased from the dewetting regime to the wetting
	regime.},

	method combines physics-based force field calculations with empirically
	derived heuristics designed to achieve efficient searching and prioritization
	of the ligand's conformational space. While many parameter settings
	are supported, four modes spanning a range of speed and quality trades-offs
	are defined and characterized. The validation set used to test the
	method is composed of ligands from 667 crystal structures covering
	a broad array of target and ligand classes. With the fastest mode,
	ConfGen uses an average of 0.5 s per ligand and generates only 14.3
	conformers per ligand, at least one of which lies within 2.0 A root-mean-squared
	deviation of the crystal structure for 96\% of the ligands. The most
	computationally intensive mode raises this recovery rate to 99\%,
	while taking 8 s per ligand. Combining multiple search modes to "fill-in"
	holes in the conformation space or energy minimizing using an all-atom
	force field each lead to improvements in the recovery rates at higher
	resolutions. Overall, ConfGen is at least as good as competing programs
	at high resolution and demonstrates higher efficiency at resolutions

  abstract = {Prediction of interaction energies between ligands and their receptors
	remains a major challenge for structure-based inhibitor discovery.
	Much effort has been devoted to developing scoring schemes that can
	successfully rank the affinities of a diverse set of possible ligands
	to a binding site for which the structure is known. To test these
	scoring functions, well-characterized experimental systems can be
	very useful. Here, mutation-created binding sites in T4 lysozyme
	were used to investigate how the quality of atomic charges and solvation
	energies affects molecular docking. Atomic charges and solvation
	energies were calculated for 172,118 molecules in the Available Chemicals
	Directory using a semi-empirical quantum mechanical approach by the
	program AMSOL. The database was first screened against the apolar
	cavity site created by the mutation Leu99Ala (L99A). Compared to
	the electronegativity-based charges that are widely used, the new
	charges and desolvation energies improved ranking of known apolar
	ligands, and better distinguished them from more polar isosteres
	that are not observed to bind. To investigate whether the new charges
	had predictive value, the non-polar residue Met102, which forms part
	of the binding site, was changed to the polar residue glutamine.
	The structure of the resulting Leu99Ala and Met102Gln double mutant
	of T4 lysozyme (L99A/M102Q) was determined and the docking calculation
	was repeated for the new site. Seven representative polar molecules
	that preferentially docked to the polar versus the apolar binding
	site were tested experimentally. All seven bind to the polar cavity
	(L99A/M102Q) but do not detectably bind to the apolar cavity (L99A).
	Five ligand-bound structures of L99A/M102Q were determined by X-ray
	crystallography. Docking predictions corresponded to the crystallographic
	results to within 0.4A RMSD. Improved treatment of partial atomic
	charges and desolvation energies in database docking appears feasible
	and leads to better distinction of true ligands. Simple model binding
	sites, such as L99A and its more polar variants, may find broad use
	in the development and testing of docking algorithms.},

  abstract = {Sampling receptor flexibility is challenging for database docking.
	We consider a method that treats multiple flexible regions of the
	binding site independently, recombining them to generate different
	discrete conformations. This algorithm scales linearly rather than
	exponentially with the receptor's degrees of freedom. The method
	was first evaluated for its ability to identify known ligands of
	a hydrophobic cavity mutant of T4 lysozyme (L99A). Some 200000 molecules
	of the Available Chemical Directory (ACD) were docked against an
	ensemble of cavity conformations. Surprisingly, the enrichment of
	known ligands from among a much larger number of decoys in the ACD
	was worse than simply docking to the apo conformation alone. Large
	decoys, accommodated in the larger cavity conformations sampled in
	the ensemble, were ranked better than known small ligands. The calculation
	was redone with an energy correction term that considered the cost
	of forming the larger cavity conformations. Enrichment improved,
	as did the balance between high-ranking large and small ligands.
	In a second retrospective test, the ACD was docked against a conformational
	ensemble of thymidylate synthase. Compared to docking against individual
	enzyme conformations, the flexible receptor docking approach improved
	enrichment of known ligands. Including a receptor conformational
	energy weighting term improved enrichment further. To test the method
	prospectively, the ACD database was docked against another cavity
	mutant of lysozyme (L99A/M102Q). A total of 18 new compounds predicted
	to bind this polar cavity and to change its conformation were tested
	experimentally; 14 were found to bind. The bound structures for seven
	ligands were determined by X-ray crystallography. The predicted geometries
	of these ligands all corresponded to the observed geometries to within
	0.7A RMSD or better. Significant conformational changes of the cavity
	were observed in all seven complexes. In five structures, part of
	the observed accommodations were correctly predicted; in two structures,
	the receptor conformational changes were unanticipated and thus never
	sampled. These results suggest that although sampling receptor flexibility
	can lead to novel ligands that would have been missed when docking
	a rigid structure, it is also important to consider receptor conformational
	energy.},

	through the inhibition of the phosphatase activity of calcineurin.
	Rapamycin (sirolimus), which is itself an immunosuppressant by a
	different mechanism, completes with FK506 for binding to FKBP12 and
	thereby acts as an antagonist of calcineurin inhibition. We have
	solved the X-ray structure of unliganded FKBP12 and of FKBP12 in
	complex with FK506 and with rapamycin; these structures show localized
	differences in conformation and mobility in those regions of the
	protein that are known, by site-directed mutagenesis, to be involved
	in calcineurin inhibition. A comparison of 16 additional X-ray structures
	of FKBP12 in complex with FKBP12-binding ligands, where those structures
	were determined from different crystal forms with distinct packing
	arrangements, lends significance to the observed structural variability
	and suggests that it represents an intrinsic functional characteristic
	of the protein. Similar differences have been observed for FKBP12
	before, but were considered artifacts of crystal-packing interactions.
	We suggest that immunosuppressive ligands express their differential
	effects in part by modulating the conformation of FKBP12, in agreement
	with mutagenesis experiments on the protein, and not simply through
	differences in the ligand structures themselves.},

	the cytochrome P450 (P450) superfamily is an important step toward
	explaining its key role in drug metabolism, toxicity, xenobiotic
	degradation, and several biosynthetic pathways. Here we investigate
	the ligand exit pathways and mechanisms of P450cam (CYP101), P450BM-3
	(CYP102), and P450eryF (CYP107A1) by using random expulsion molecular
	dynamics and classical molecular dynamics simulations. Although several
	different pathways are found for each protein, one pathway is common
	to all three. The mechanism of ligand exit along this pathway is,
	however, quite different in the three different proteins. For P450cam,
	small backbone conformational changes, in combination with aromatic
	side chain rotation, allow for the passage of the rather rigid, compact,
	and hydrophobic substrate, camphor. In P450BM-3, larger transient
	backbone changes are observed on ligand exit. R47, situated at the
	entrance to the channel, appears important in guiding negatively
	charged fatty acid substrates in and out of the active site. In P450eryF,
	an isolated buried arginine, R185, stabilized by four hydrogen bonds
	to backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms, is located in the exit channel
	and is identified as having a particularly unusual functionality,
	dynamically gating channel opening. The results for these three P450s
	suggest that the channel opening mechanisms are adjusted to the physico-chemical
	properties of the substrate and can kinetically modulate protein-substrate
	specificity.},

  abstract = {A general methodology for calculating the equilibrium binding constant
	of a flexible ligand to a protein receptor is formulated on the basis
	of potentials of mean force. The overall process is decomposed into
	several stages that can be computed separately: the free ligand in
	the bulk is first restrained into the conformation it adopts in the
	bound state, position, and orientation by applying biasing potentials,
	then it is translated into the binding site, where it is released
	completely. The conformational restraining potential is based on
	the root-mean-square deviation of the peptide coordinates relative
	to its average conformation in the bound complex. Free energy contributions
	from each stage are calculated by means of free energy perturbation
	potential of mean force techniques by using appropriate order parameters.
	The present approach avoids the need to decouple the ligand from
	its surrounding (bulk solvent and receptor protein) as is traditionally
	performed in the double-decoupling scheme. It is believed that the
	present formulation will be particularly useful when the solvation
	free energy of the ligand is very large. As an application, the equilibrium

	sampled along lambda are allowed to mix, which leads to dramatic

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of the binding affinities of small-molecule ligands
	to their biological targets is fundamental for structure-based drug
	design but remains a very challenging task. In this paper, we have
	performed computational studies to predict the binding models of
	31 small-molecule Smac (the second mitochondria-derived activator
	of caspase) mimetics to their target, the XIAP (X-linked inhibitor
	of apoptosis) protein, and their binding affinities. Our results
	showed that computational docking was able to reliably predict the
	binding models, as confirmed by experimentally determined crystal
	structures of some Smac mimetics complexed with XIAP. However, all
	the computational methods we have tested, including an empirical
	scoring function, two knowledge-based scoring functions, and MM-GBSA
	(molecular mechanics and generalized Born surface area), yield poor
	to modest prediction for binding affinities. The linear correlation
	coefficient (r(2)) value between the predicted affinities and the
	experimentally determined affinities was found to be between 0.21
	and 0.36. Inclusion of ensemble protein-ligand conformations obtained
	from molecular dynamic simulations did not significantly improve
	the prediction. However, major improvement was achieved when the
	free-energy change for ligands between their free- and bound-states,
	or "ligand-reorganization free energy", was included in the MM-GBSA
	calculation, and the r(2) value increased from 0.36 to 0.66. The
	prediction was validated using 10 additional Smac mimetics designed
	and evaluated by an independent group. This study demonstrates that
	ligand reorganization free energy plays an important role in the
	overall binding free energy between Smac mimetics and XIAP. This
	term should be evaluated for other ligand-protein systems and included
	in the development of new scoring functions. To our best knowledge,
	this is the first computational study to demonstrate the importance
	of ligand reorganization free energy for the prediction of protein-ligand

	that solvate the confined regions of protein active sites. Our simulations
	and analysis indicate that the solvation of protein active sites
	that are characterized by hydrophobic enclosure and correlated hydrogen
	bonds induce atypical entropic and enthalpic penalties of hydration.
	These penalties apparently stabilize the protein-ligand complex with
	respect to the independently solvated ligand and protein, which leads
	to enhanced binding affinities. Our analysis elucidates several challenging
	cases, including the super affinity of the streptavidin-biotin system.},

	To understand some of the basic mechanisms that determine the efficiency

	Results are presented concerning the efficiency of temperature RE

	We have constructed a kinetic network model for RE studies of protein
	folding and used this reduced model to carry out "simulations of
	simulations" to analyze how the underlying temperature dependence
	of the conformational kinetics and the basic parameters of RE (e.g.,
	the number of replicas, the RE rate, and the temperature spacing)
	all interact to affect the number of folding transitions observed.
	When protein folding follows anti-Arrhenius kinetics, we observe
	a speed limit for the number of folding transitions observed at the
	low temperature of interest, which depends on the maximum of the
	harmonic mean of the folding and unfolding transition rates at high
	temperature. The results shown here for the network RE model suggest
	ways to improve atomic-level RE simulations such as the use of "training"
	simulations to explore some aspects of the temperature dependence
	for folding of the atomic-level models before performing RE studies.},

  abstract = {The weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) has become the standard
	technique for the analysis of umbrella sampling simulations. In this
	article, we address the challenges (1) of obtaining fast and accurate
	solutions of the coupled nonlinear WHAM equations, (2) of quantifying
	the statistical errors of the resulting free energies, (3) of diagnosing
	possible systematic errors, and (4) of optimally allocating of the
	computational resources. Traditionally, the WHAM equations are solved
	by a fixed-point direct iteration method, despite poor convergence
	and possible numerical inaccuracies in the solutions. Here, we instead
	solve the mathematically equivalent problem of maximizing a target
	likelihood function, by using superlinear numerical optimization
	algorithms with a significantly faster convergence rate. To estimate
	the statistical errors in one-dimensional free energy profiles obtained
	from WHAM, we note that for densely spaced umbrella windows with
	harmonic biasing potentials, the WHAM free energy profile can be
	approximated by a coarse-grained free energy obtained by integrating
	the mean restraining forces. The statistical errors of the coarse-grained
	free energies can be estimated straightforwardly and then used for
	the WHAM results. A generalization to multidimensional WHAM is described.
	We also propose two simple statistical criteria to test the consistency
	between the histograms of adjacent umbrella windows, which help identify
	inadequate sampling and hysteresis in the degrees of freedom orthogonal
	to the reaction coordinate. Together, the estimates of the statistical
	errors and the diagnostics of inconsistencies in the potentials of
	mean force provide a basis for the efficient allocation of computational
	resources in free energy simulations. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
